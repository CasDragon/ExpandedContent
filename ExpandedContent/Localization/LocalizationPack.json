Abhoth has an otherworldly wisdom and a staggering intellect, yet it does not devote its mind to matters that mortals could comprehend. It’s not so much trapped as it is cradled in a cavern lair connected to many worlds. The creatures it constantly spawns that manage to escape its ravenous gluttony and eternal hunger stagger upward through the nighted ways, growing stronger and larger the longer they survive. The greatest find paths through ancient portals in those caves to other worlds, where they may spawn entire societies and races of their own. Abhoth’s cultists maintain that all life in the universe was spawned by the Unclean God, and that in our flesh and bones lie traces of its divine excretions. Abhoth appears as a vast lake of seething, surging, protoplasmic ooze in which eyes and mouths and limbs and organs constantly form and are consumed.

According to the Windsong Testaments, Achaekek was one of the first eight deities of this incarnation of creation, and originated as a lawful neutral judge over good and evil. When the first deities turned their attention toward the Material Plane, Achaekek stood sentinel at the edge of Pharasma's Spire to oversee the creation of life. Near the end of the Age of Creation, when Rovagug was rampaging across creation, Achaekek consumed his own impartiality and descended into savagery, becoming a mindless beast. Whatever his true origins may be, Achaekek was created as an agent for the gods, an enforcer of divine justice, specifically targeting all mortals who hoped to usurp the power of a god and achieve divinity. Not wishing to be become targets of He Who Walks in Blood themselves, however, they made him incapable of killing those who truly were gods, restricting his powers to slay those of demigod status or below."

She is implacable in her opposition to evil, but is the first to remind her celestial kin that if victories come without care for the vulnerable, the battle is won at the cost of the war. Adults often find it difficult to look her in the eye, yet many an orphaned child has been awakened from a nightmare by a hand stroking his hair, then lulled back to peaceful sleep by the creaking of a rocking chair and an unshakable sense that he is cherished and protected. Few have seen Grandmother Crow’s feather cape open into her great black wings, but the thunderclap that accompanies such a moment leaves even demon lords shaken, while those who shelter behind her find any fear dispelled. Though she prefers to avoid battles, seeing Heaven as defined most by what it does while it is at peace rather than at war, Andoletta is a cunning, inimitable opponent when roused. She roams Golarion’s most dire places, seeking cracks in evildoers’ resolve through which the light of redemption can enter their souls, fanning the sparks of hope in any weary hearts of the virtuous, reminding the grieving that sorrow need not consume their capacity for joy, and teaching hard lessons to those who would prey on the less fortunate."

Apep is a great golden serpent miles long, and his crushing coils encircle the world.

Arshea is worshipped by artisans, courtesans, some fey, and those seeking to escape repression. They eschew gender roles and often dress and behave as members of the opposite sex (or another gender role in societies with multiple gender roles) for a period of time ranging from months to decades, which they consider the best way to overcome repression and understand freedom, choosing the most fitting gender after this period of pilgrimage. Arshea teaches them to abandon constraining beliefs and practice free love and sexuality. Arshea has no permanent home, and constantly travels through the Material Plane, Nirvana, Elysium and Heaven.   \nAppearance: Arshea is androgynous and has been depicted as both male and female, but in either case, always dressed in many-colored veils of gossamer. Indeed, Arshea is of both genders and neither, unhindered by such differences. Arshea has a perfect face, a lithe body, and wings of gray and blue. Their form is seen as ideal by any species that look upon them, and some claim that those who directly behold Arshea can never be satisfied with mortal beauty again."

In truth, constructs as prosaic as gender are but afterthoughts to Atlach-Nacha. Dwelling in a vast underground cavern large enough to swallow entire nations, Atlach-Nacha weaves an impossibly complex web to span the gulf. Texts claim that on the day its vast bridge finally connects all sides of this complex canyon, a new age of madness will be unleashed, while others purport that Atlach-Nacha’s web-bridges are to be used by the Outer God Abhoth to surge out of its deep cavern rather than sending forth only its spawn. Those who venerate Atlach-Nacha see the divine in the spider’s form. Many of its worshipers are arachnid creatures, such as driders, ettercaps, and jorogumos. These latter beings have been known to take the name of Atlach-Nacha themselves when they invade human societies, although their goal in appropriating the god’s name is unclear. Atlach-Nacha appears as a huge black-andred spider with a body the size of an elephant and long, spindly legs. Its face is vaguely humanoid, with hairrimmed eyes, but in certain obscure sources it has also been depicted as having multiple arms and a woman’s head and torso. Many of the spiders of Leng venerate it as their mother, and doubtless the tunnels below Leng eventually connect to Atlach-Nacha’s web-strewn canyon lair."

Azathoth is unaware of its worshipers, and indeed has little interest in anything. Some scholars theorize that Azathoth isn’t even self-aware, likening the outer god to a cosmic firestorm on the grandest scale, an entity incapable of directing action or reacting to stimuli. Azathoth is attended by an unknown number of other gods that orbit it as a solar system’s planets might orbit an angry star. Referred to in eldritch tomes as Azathoth’s Court, these lesser gods are themselves powerful beings whose insane songs and eerie piping provide a constant accompaniment to Azathoth’s chaotic babblings and thunderous explosions. Many worshipers of Azathoth liken the entities of Azathoth’s court to the true manifestation of their god’s conscious will. Although lesser than Azathoth, these gods are themselves quite powerful, and the greatest of them is none other than Nyarlathotep, the Crawling Chaos. Said to lie at the center of the universe, Azathoth is believed by some to be the source of all existence, the primal truth that created the Material Plane. Cultists of the Primal Chaos often seek to harness their blind god’s power for their own destructive ends, yet such attempts are fraught with peril, for the tiniest ripple caused by Azathoth’s thrashings can lay waste to entire planets. The Shory are said to have developed ways to harness this power, but it seems just as likely that tampering with such forces may have played a key role in that empire’s mysterious fall so long ago. Azathoth is referenced as the “Daemon Sultan” in some ancient texts, but this appellation does not imply any connection to the fiends known as daemons, for Azathoth has as little interest in matters of the Great Beyond as it does anything else."

She also guards against contagious diseases, evil spirits, and snakes, and is associated with protective ointments and perfumes. A beautiful woman with the head of a cat, Bastet is often depicted holding a rattle-like sistrum, a musical instrument associated with her worship-and a small shield called an aegis, usually decorated with the head of a lion, as a symbol of her protective role. Bastet is the daughter of Ra, and the sister of Hathor, Maat, and Sekhmet. Normally indolent and relaxed, Bastet can be fierce when roused to anger, and she has often faced off against the great serpent Apep on behalf of Ra. A promiscuous goddess, Bastet has no mate, but numerous stories detail her liaisons with other deities. Bastet is a popular goddess among bards and women of all classes, and she is the patron of spies, rogues, and thieves."

An amiable and inclusive deity, Bes encompasses all types of families under his protection, and is both a god of childbirth and a defender of children. He is the guardian of sleep, protecting against evil spirits and all manner of dangerous beasts, from scorpions and snakes to lions and crocodiles. Bes appears as an ugly, bandy-legged dwarf, with a large head, big eyes, a full beard, and an open mouth with a comically protruding tongue. He wears a headdress of ostrich feathers and a lion skin cloak. In contrast to the other gods of Ancient Osirion, who were usually shown in profile, Bes was always depicted facing forward. Bes is friendly with most of the other Ancient Osirian gods, but always keeps a watchful eye out for Apep and Set and their servants. Bes has few temples and ordained priests, but his joviality makes him popular among bards, professional performers, and serving boys and girls, who also view him as a patron of music, dance, and sexual pleasure, and such worshipers frequently wear small tattoos of Bes for protection and luck. Pregnant women and new mothers also pray to him to watch over their children. Though Bes has few proper temples, simple shrines to the Guardian Fool can be found in many Osirian cities, particularly in entertainment districts."

As the goddess worked, she realized she had created a pattern of spaces between the stars. When Desna placed the final star, a shadowy butterfly formed in the spaces between and sprang into existence. This is the Black Butterfly, Desna's Shadow. The Black Butterfly appears as the living silhouette of a graceful woman with white hair and eyes. Her expansive black butterfly wings hold reflections of all the stars, planets, and galaxies in creation. One of the stars on the Black Butterfly's wings is actually her magical starknife, Voidsedge, which can disappear from her wing and appear in her hand with a thought. The Silence Between knows the value of stillness. She has seen the great expanse of space, and its vast and awful silence is reflected in her ancient eyes. Those who live lives of silence, happily or unhappily, turn to the Black Butterfly as one who understands their solemn existence. Explorers venturing into strange territories offer prayers to the Black Butterfly as well. Desna's Shadow teaches that in the silences between breaths and thoughts, one can see one's true nature. While she despises all the forces of evil, she holds particular enmity for the entities of the Dark Tapestry, and it is said she possesses great knowledge about the Dark Tapestry to which she refuses to give voice."

As humans rose to prominence on the Material Plane, they inevitably came into violent conflict with these creatures. Humans prevailed, but a thousand years later, the spirits of the slain worshipers of Bokrug rose to exact a terrible revenge. Today, in remote regions of the Dimension of Dreams, Bokrug is worshiped out of fear as much as devotion. When those who encounter Bokrug’s cult while traveling this dimension waken, they often carry in their minds the seeds of faith. In this manner, Bokrug’s cult has spread to the waking world. Compared to other deities of the Elder Mythos, Bokrug seems relatively content to bask in the adoration of his worshipers and the powerful storms that often visit the distant dreaming lands he dwells within. The Great Old One does not often seek to destroy others, by design or by accident. Only when his anger and thirst for vengeance are aroused does Bokrug go on the hunt. Bokrug appears as an immense aquatic lizard with spines and sickly green scales. His exceptionally long tail ends in three terrible spines, and his breath is said to be a poisonous green mist. His cult is typically found in rural regions, where worship of the Water Lizard seems to do wonders in the bringing of fine weather and prosperity—as long as blood sacrifices to Bokrug continue. Although he does not demand the sacrifice of sentient creatures, many of his cults have nonetheless taken to sacrificing prisoners or criminals."

Rumor holds that when the last mortal dies and the Shepherd is whole, Ceyannan will finally embrace death themself. Until that peace comes, Ceyannan relentlessly hunts missing souls, reserving a special hatred for those who would destroy souls or pervert them into undeath. As the patron of lost souls, they are also responsible for containing those souls that pose an existential threat to the cosmos. Ceyannan’s flesh is maggot-white and impossibly beautiful, and their otherwise humanoid frame sports a pair of wings covered in the oily, black feathers of a carrion bird.

Chadali appears as a beautiful, middle-aged Vudrani woman who stands firmly on the ground but whose dark eyes often lift to the sky. Fresh water lilies peep out from the coiled masses of her shining black hair, and she wears silken robes of pale yellow that fall to her bare feet. In her hands she holds a net woven of red threads; tiny rubies glimmer within the folds of the net. The Serendipitous Path teaches that fate is beautiful in its unpredictability. Seemingly insignificant events can determine the course of an entire life. Her agents visit those who are afraid to take chances and encourage them to step out into the world and trust fate. The greatest evil, in Chadali's eyes , is rigidly structuring one's life to prevent unexpected events from happening.

For thousands of millennia, Chaugnar Faugn has dwelled, dormant and immobile, in a shallow cave lost within the depths of a desolate stretch of rugged hill country. This is how the Great Old One gained his appellation as the Horror from the Hills, and most of his more ardent worshipers are those who dwell in such backcountry. Yet he has no particular affinity to the slopes and vales that hide him; they are merely where he has waited for the past unknown eons. Chaugnar Faugn’s faithful adopt the Great Old One’s patience. They are violent and eager for blood, yet they wait generations before acting on plans for vengeance or raids. Many times, the cultists’ enemies have believed them to have been exterminated after a brutal conflict, but each and every time, this was a misconception. The worshipers of the Horror from the Hills were merely content to wait for a proper chance at revenge. In those rare occasions when Chaugnar Faugn does wake, though, worship does nothing to deter his hunger; he feeds on zealots and unbelievers with equal disdain. Chaugnar Faugn is vaguely humanoid in form, yet his head is that of a distorted, nightmarish elephant with vast veined ears, enormous curved tusks, and a trunk that ends in a large disk through which he drains the blood of those who draw too near."

Legend tells that thousands of years ago, an angel fell asleep in a misty dale in Elysium. The angel dreamed of a beautiful woman with a basket full of ethereal visions. When she awoke, she saw her dream made real as Chucaro stepped out of the mist. Chucaro's pale skin gleams iride scently and her eyes shift from color to color in a neverending spectrum. Her frame is draped in robes of living mist. Her waist-length mass of rippled hair shimmers, colorless, like a cascade of rain that rushes continually from her brow. She has a sweet, serious face, and always seems to be listening to something just on the edge of hearing. To combat those fiends who would pervert the visions she grants, Chucaro summons a sap formed of churning mists-anyone struck by the blackjack is overwhelmed by disorienting hallucinations. The Maiden of Haze and Whimsy brings comfort to those afflicted with mad delusions. She soothes their fevers and helps them make sense of the strange images that plague their minds. To her dedicated followers she brings bright, lucid dreams every night. She frowns on those who use harsh drugs to induce visions at the cost of their physical health; Chucaro's agents strive to bring such broken individuals back to health and teach them to draw phantasmagoria from within rather than through the use of external implements. Chucaro can often be found in a delicate house of iridescent pearl in the silver-gray lowlands of Elysium."

Yet only one has managed to do both these things and still exert influence over both the First World and the planes beyond. The creature known as Count Ranalc, for reasons long lost to history—first rose to power in the early days of the multiverse as a physical embodiment of primal darkness and the chaos of creation. Tall and gaunt, constantly wrapped in inky shadow, he was always difficult for the other fey lords to work with, his arrogance born from both power and the knowledge that, in the end, his domain of darkness would consume all things. Still, the other Eldest respected his strength and the necessity of chaos in fueling the fires of existence, which makes it all the more surprising that they eventually banded together to exile him from the plane entirely. What Ranalc did to rouse the ire—or self-preservation—of the other Eldest remains one of the First World’s greatest mysteries, but it was at that point, millennia ago, that he was first given the appellation “the Traitor.” Cast out onto the Shadow Plane, Ranalc shocked the others by refusing to be beaten, instead creating a stronghold within the darkness and embracing his new role as lord of exiles and betrayal. From his darkened realm, he continued to grant power to his followers and influence both the First World and Material Plane. Yet even then the mystery of the dark lord was not yet complete. Though historical records dating all the way back to the Age of Anguish show evidence of Ranalc’s machinations on Golarion, he abruptly disappeared from both his shadowed court and the pages of history in the third century of the Age of Anguish. Whatever the truth, the fact that he continues to grant magic to his followers indicates that, wherever the missing demigod has gone, he has not yet met the same fate as Aroden."

His cult is spread in this manner, as those sensitive to his dreams of madness (typically half-insane artists, poets, and visionaries) waken with memories not wholly their own. Upon waking, these afflicted artists and dreamers may not even consciously recall their dreams or realize that their actions have been influenced. Cthulhu’s spawn—tremendous entities similar in shape and purpose to their great master—also spread his terrible worship, but deadly as they are, they possess but a shadow of Cthulhu’s power. Cthulhu’s cults are secretive, based in remote swamplands, dense forests, and sprawling sewers under the world’s greatest cities. They know that one day the stars shall align and their master’s city will rise again above the waves on that distant, doomed planet, at which point it is merely a matter of time before they are rewarded with the arrival of their terrible deity upon Golarion as he wipes entire worlds clean in preparation for the return of all of the Outer Gods. Cthulhu is a massive creature, roughly humanoid in shape but hideously inhuman in many regards, with an octopoid face, immense wings, and foul protoplasmic flesh that writhes in ways no flesh should. While imprisoned, his mad thoughts can touch only a dreaming few, but once awake, his alien mind will spread like a virus of insanity through all thinking souls."

A quivering, spherical clot of fungal matter much larger than the largest of planets, the Jeharlu lies at the center of an immense cavern, suspended by thick white filaments that attach it to the surrounding rift. Pallid giant worms, moldering shamblers, deformed fungoid dragons, and all manner of demons are but a few of the Jeharlu’s dangers. Cyth-V’sug dwells at the heart of this fungal sphere, an immense monstrosity that appears as a tangled mass of fungal tubers, tentacles, and grasping claws topped by a heaving draconic body with puff ball eyes and jagged teeth. Cyth-V’sug can be thought of as a planetary parasite that infests worlds and consumes them, adding the waste that he leaves behind to his ever-expanding Abyssal realm. One of Cyth-V’sug’s greatest minions, the nascent demon lord Treerazer, recently established a domain on the Material Plane after a failed coup against Cyth-V’sug, yet curiously, the Prince of the Blasted Heath has done little to strike against his wayward minion since."

Not quite fish or octopus or eel, Dagon is fond of sending his spawn into the oceans of the Material Plane to spread his inf luence, often physically by breeding with creatures of the deeps or among isolated coastal-dwelling societies. Marsh giants are traditionally among his most fervent worshipers on land, yet in certain remote locations (particularly along the western coastlines of Avistan and Garund), his cult is growing among humans. A village that turns to the worship of Dagon often does so secretly, maintaining a facade of worshiping another deity when in fact the town’s devotions are for the Shadow in the Sea. In the most remote locations, these cults mix with sahuagin, boggards, and other hideous aquatic creatures. The deformed hybrid children of such blasphemous unions are sure signs of Dagon worship. In these regions, such deformities are regarded as badges of honor."

Concerned as they are with walking back from death, Dammar is also the usher of doctors, medicine, and, due to its long history of use in medical preparations, alcohol and those who produce it. Legends say Dammar created the hangover to grant mortals a peek beyond the veil. Dammar manifests as a portly, androgynous figure swathed in several layers of silk robes, who hides their face behind a veil. Six insectile legs emerge from beneath their robes, and while no arms normally emerge from the swirl of fabric encompassing them, Dammar can manifest dozens at a time to manage various tasks. This uncanny ability—along with their supposed fondness for cockroaches—earns the Denied their unofficial reputation as the usher of insects and creeping things."

How an individual meets her end and why weigh heavily on the spirit in the afterlife. Damerrich understands that evil must sometimes be slain, but never lightly, never easily. Damerrich takes on the weight of all the necessary executions and just deaths in the world. Executioners look to this empyreal lord whenever they have qualms with their line of work, and Damerrich teaches them that while their duty is a s ober and joy-free one, it is necessary to ensure peace and goodness. Damerrich is a silent, monolithic figure clad in black stone armor. His handsome, hairless face is mostly hidden behind his helm; only his weary eyes are clearly visible. Judges, whether appointed officials in city courthouses or village leaders acting as part of a tribunal, pray to Damerrich for guidance in their judgments. Good people may understand the need for executions but shrink from the act; Damerrich and his agents help reas sure them when executions are appropriate or take the burden of mortal guilt upon themselves. Those wrongly sentenced to death pray for intercession from Damerrich, and can hope to receive help in the form of one of his divine agents. Corrupt judges and careless executioners rouse the Weighted Swing's ire like nothing else. Similarly, if an accused deserving of death is set free, Damerrich's agents might appear both to perform the just execution and to chastise those who set the criminal free. The Weighted Swing does not take pleasure in his grim but necessary task, and those who take the matter of execution too lightly or who sadistically revel in the act may expect retribution from Damerrich's chosen elimination squad of shield archons, known as Those of the Heaving Hand."

Also known as the Iron Lord, Father of Dis and First King, Dispater is one of the more active rulers of Hell and one of Asmodeus's closest and longest-standing allies. His unholy symbol is an iron spike driven into a golden ring with a red and purple crown. His symbol of office is an artefact known as The Eclipsing Eye. Alone among the lords of Hell, Dispater believes in the virtues of courtly love, and has taken three wives over the course of his eons-long existence. The first is forgotten, even by the Iron Lord himself, the only token of her existence a shattered statue in Dispater's throne room. The second was Feronia, an elemental demigoddess with whom Dispater shared a brief, tempestuous relationship that led to the birth of his son, the empyreal lord Ragathiel. Dispater's third and current wife is Erecura, a once-mortal demigoddess who was condemned to Hell for stealing the secret of eternal life from Pharasma. Dispater has allied with the archdevil Mephistopheles as they both enjoy the art of ruling, and is married to Erecura.   \nAppearance: Dispater appears as a majestic, seven-foot-tall figure with rust-red skin, four horns, and a burning crown that hovers above his head. His skin bears dozens of scars and piercings, each of them a past wound turned into a mark of pride. He retains his angelic wings, though they are now black, and he keeps them retracted within his body at almost all times. The First King's staff of office is The Eclipsing Eye, a bladed staff with a great ruby through which Asmodeus constantly watches him."

The Dark Mother is not a goddess of love, but of possessiveness. As the goddess of fertility, she watches over female orcs during pregnancy, birthing, and child rearing. She promotes mating, families, and tribes, not because she is a nurturing deity, but because she believes in strength in numbers and fostering strong warriors. Dretha is the patron of crafts, yet all orc gods are war gods, and Dretha is no different. The Dark Mother blesses those who fight jealously to defend their mates, children, lands, and possessions from enemies who would steal or destroy them. Dretha is depicted as a heavily pregnant orc. Sculptures of the Dark Mother emphasize her swollen belly and breasts, while leaving her head and limbs small and lacking in detail. Legends describe Dretha as a sullen goddess who rarely speaks. Yet the stories told by true devotees say her melancholy is a cage that holds a burning rage within. Orcs typically claim Dretha is the mate of the male god their tribe holds in highest esteem. Dretha is the most widely revered of the orc gods, and while tribes may come to blows over which orc god is superior, all acknowledge the Dark Mother. Dretha is primarily worshiped by female orcs, who sacrifice to her to ensure safe childbirth and strong children. But all orcs, regardless of their gender, seek the Dark Mother’s aid in matters of defense or procreation. Tales tell of Dretha’s ancient conflict with Lamashtu, and rarely do her followers also venerate the demonic Mother of Monsters."

From beneath the weight of these lies rang out a single truth, which flew free of the fifth layer of Hell before ascending to the upper planes. That truth was Eritrice. The muscular Eritrice stands 8 feet tall, and her feminine form is typically covered with a pale brown pelt. Her head is that of a female lion's and her eyes gleam like amethysts. She wears a short leather kilt beneath a rose-colored breastplate. Eritrice's voice is so compelling, it is said, that those who hear her speak forget her remarkable appearance. Eritrice works to spread truth and wisdom throughout the world, but believes that insight gained through spirited debate is more valuable than knowledge gleaned from books. Her agents encourage discussion and respectful disagreement. In regions where lies are spoken aloud but truth remains hidden, Eritrice and her minions help good individuals pass messages. Geryon and his minions are Heart-Speaker's sworn enemies, and the two are known to have had titanic battles in the past. Heart-Speaker makes her home on the broad, sun-soaked plains of Nirvana. Her favorite spot is the Windswept Lea, a green and verdant meadow. When entertaining guests, she stays in a grand pavilion of chestnut wood, whose walls open to the sweet grassland and whose rooms are separated by hanging shantung curtains."

Her mate, whose name has been lost to history, fell in combat against the minions of Moloch. Falayna recovered her lover's sword from the teeth of Hell, and from then on she shone as Warrior's Ring. Falayna epitomizes feminine beauty. Though she can take many forms, she often appears as a fair-skinned woman with glossy brown hair and intense blue eyes. Her silk robes complement the silver breastplate beneath, and the empyreal lord carries her razor-edged longsword, Betrothal, with her always. Glittering rings of every imaginable hue bedeck Falayna's fingers; in combat, punishing strikes from her ringed fist complement the swings ofher blessed longsword. Both male and female warriors pay homage to Falayna's skill, though most of her followers are women. Jewelers often seek to craft rings \"worthy of Falayna's little finger,\" and squires in training look to Falayna for guidance.

Both entities are trapped in immense structures atop sunken islands. Both came to the same distant world in ancient times from the dark places between the stars. And when they wake, their actions cause great storms or disasters, as if the world itself recoiled from their actions. These similarities may be more than superficial, for evidence exists that Ghatanothoa may be one of Cthulhu’s spawn. The worshipers of the Eternal Source deny such claims, and fight against the cult of Cthulhu when they encounter it. Cthulhu’s cult, on the other hand, treats the worshipers of Ghatanothoa as insignificant and no more worthy of notice than any other gathering of mortal madness. The Eternal Source’s insane worshipers are said to be able to raise islands on distant worlds from unknown oceans that serve as portals between the Eternal Source and new vistas to conquer. Ghatanothoa’s form is said to be particularly horrific, and no two accounts are the same; all they agree on is that the merest glance is enough to transform the foolish viewer instantly into a desiccated, living mummy capable of observing the world and feeling the endless passage of time, but incapable of moving or otherwise interacting with the world. This form of immortality is said to be among the most horrific fates a mortal mind could endure."

At first glance, Ghenshau could be mistaken for a Tian peasant boy, often wearing a hat of woven rushes and simple linen clothes. The hat shelters his beautiful face and his level, serene gaze. His clothes bear elegantly embroidered trim depicting fantastic birds, foo creatures, and runes. He carries a pipe in his hand and a workman's axe tucked into his rope belt. Ghenshau and his followers do not hold civilization in contempt, but they do believe the unnecessary complications of society distract people from doing their best. An artisan who maintains a neat shop and works on one project at a time is much happier and more pleasing to Ghenshau than a harried worker in a disarrayed shop. Of course, Ghenshau realizes that the demands of life can force people into lives they are not happy with, simply so they and their families can keep body and soul together. He understands that such circumstances are not always avoidable, and sends his agents to help such flustered individuals find a way out of their dreary responsibilities."

Scholars of the demonic believe it more likely that she was a herzrou in Dagon’s service who ascended to the role of demon lord by more traditional means—certainly she favors the hezrous as guardians and lovers, and often sends them to guard or even lead boggard tribes on the Material Plane (particularly tribes in Varisia’s Mushfens, the River Kingdoms, or the Sodden Lands). Gogunta is unusual among the demon lords in that her realm is not wholly her own—the stinking saltmarsh of Mephizim is a vast region, yet it is contained wholly within the realm of Dagon’s Ishiar. Mephizim floats upon the surface of the vast sea of Ishiar, being pulled idly along by the current. Despite the swampy island’s continental size, it remains a relative speck on the surface of the great Abyssal sea. Dagon seems content to let Gogunta rule her tiny realm above his own, ignoring her blasphemous cavortings. Gogunta’s cult often mingles freely with that of Dagon on the Material Plane, with her boggards and Dagon’s cultists mixing and mating in disgusting ways that nature never intended. Gogunta appears as an immense, multi-headed frog with too many eyes and even more tongues, but in some boggard artwork she appears instead as an immense boggard queen."

      "enGB": "\nType: Druidic  \nLeader: \bThe Archdruid   \nDomains: Air, Earth, Animal, Fire, Plant. \nFavoured Weapons: Sickle, Quarterstaff\nThe Green Faith (also known as the Old Faith, the Great Eld, or the Wyrd) is a naturalistic philosophy based on the belief that natural forces are worthy of attention and respect. Followers of the Green Faith meditate daily, commune with natural forms of power, and show respect to nature in all things. They often hang fresh herbs from the lintels of doorways as a sign of respect for nature. Although the Green Faith is based on nature, one need not be a druid to value its tenets, nor do all druids necessarily count themselves as members of this philosophy, although almost all of them appreciate its values. On Golarion, the Green Faith is centred in Andoran, Nirmathas, Taldor, and the River Kingdoms. Sarkoris, prior to its destruction at the hands of demons, was formerly the Green Faith's greatest bastion; since then, Green Faith holdouts continue their fight to protect nature from the corruption of the Worldwound. Humans, elves, and half-elves make up the majority of the Green Faith's members. The Green Faith is one of the oldest forms of worship in Golarion, as evidenced by the numerous druidic symbols found in the cave drawings of early man. According to legend, in the earliest years of its existence, the Green Faith was split into four factions. One group venerated the strength and endurance of stone, another the power and ferocity of wild beasts, a third the bountiful earth, and the last, the cleansing purity of fire. For years, these four factions fought for supremacy, each claiming that the aspect of nature it venerated was the most important. Finally, the leaders of the four factions agreed to resolve their conflict through single combat. Before the battle could begin, however, a multicolored geyser sprang from the ground, equal parts water, earth, and flame. The geyser was followed by an enormous flock of multicolored birds, which flew off in all directions. The faction leaders saw this as a clear sign from nature that no one element could be more important than another, and that ultimately, the four factions shared the same basic philosophy."

From her shoulders sweep shell-like red wings marked with the distinctive black spots of a ladybug. Two slender black antennae curve up from her temples, and sleek black hair falls to her shoulders. Halcamora can be found where sunlight shines on cultivated garden plots, where workers rest after a day in the fields, and anywhere where wine flows and grapes ripen. The Lady of Ripe Bounty leaves wilder areas to others and contents herself with small gardens, parks, and wineries. Peaceful farming communities that build temples to more powerful nature gods often raise a small shrine to Halcamora as well. Gardeners and vintners pay particular homage to the Lady of Ripe Bounty and her celestial agents, particularly in times of drought or harsh weather. The gentle agathion has little room for hatred in her heart, but she despises insect-bodied fiends who blight crops and carry plague. Halcamora is a social empyreal lord and can often been found visiting the palaces of others, relaxing with a jug of wine at her elbow. At other times she resides in a leafy bower in the depths of the Forest of Whispered Longing in Nirvana."

He requires the assistance of powerful magic in order to manifest this avatar, known as the King in Yellow, but such magic need not be consciously wrought. His cultists are masters of subtle magics that can trick unsuspecting victims into opening the way for the King in Yellow. Hastur’s symbol, the Yellow Sign, is often used in conjunction with such magic, and often those who find the Yellow Sign become doomed to host the King in Yellow in their own minds, slowly transforming into his agents. Some of his followers regard him as a patron of shepherds, believing that the bulk of humanity are but sheep to be gathered for an unknown future use. None know what Hastur looks like, for he has been imprisoned far longer than mortal life has existed. Those he takes as avatars when manifesting as the King in Yellow appear as entities clad in what seem to be frayed and tattered yellow robes. Only upon closer inspection are the “robes” revealed to be the creatures’ flesh, and what lies hidden under the darkened hoods is horror incarnate."

Hathor appears as a voluptuous cow-headed woman with the solar disk ofher father Ra between her horns and carrying a sistrum. Sometimes she is depicted as a human woman with a horned headdress. More rarely, she is depicted as a great wild cow whose milk nourishes the living. Hathor is a patron and protector of women, and is worshiped by mothers, wives, and lovers of all ages. She also serves as a patron ofbards, dancers, musicians, and performers, which makes her a popular deity in thriving cities and their playhouses. In her role as a goddess of trade, Hathor is also a patron of miners, particularly those who mine for precious stones. Hathor's priesthood is predominantly female, and her temples hold great festivals full of music and dance where worshipers consume large amounts of beer and wine and revel for days on end."

He is also a sun god, and in the form of Horakhty he is a deity of both the rising and setting suns. The posthumous son of Osiris and Isis, Horus faced off against the usurper Set, and with his victory over the Lord of the Dark Desert, Horus became the rightful heir of Osiris. Horus took his father's place as king and ruled Osirion with his consort Hathor during the Age of Anguish, becoming also a god of kings and pharaonic rule. Horus appears as a man with the head of a falcon wearing the traditional double crown of pharaohs called the pschent. He is also sometimes represented as a great celestial falcon. His symbol, the eye of Horus, is used to ward off evil, and the symbol commonly appears on protective amulets and trinkets. As a sun deity and god of kings, Horus lends his support to Ra, and aids him in his continuous battles against Apep. An ally of Osiris and Isis , Horus is a steadfast enemy of Set, and the two have fought countless battles over the ages. Horus is worshiped by kings and pharaohs, as well as by hunters, paladins, rangers, and warriors. He is sometimes venerated as part of a triad with Osiris and Isis, or as one-half of a royal couple with his consort Hathor, but there are temples dedicated solely to Horus as well. Though rare in this age, Horus' clergy gets along well with the faithful of Abadar, as both churche s value leadership and law. Temples to Horus are still found in the larger cities of Osirion."

The entity called Imbrex takes the form of two immense statues of identical androgynous humanoids, their abbreviated features and smooth skin suggesting a vaguely reptilian nature. Whether these statues are in fact the Eldest’s bodies or simply monuments in which their consciousness resides remains an enigma, as does the question of whether the Twins are siblings sharing some sort of hive mind or a single creature split into two bodies. Regardless, for as long as the Twins have stood, they have never been seen to move or change expression. To most observers, the only signs of their sentience are the booming telepathic commands capable of shattering minds or elevating them, as well as the strange, addictive dreams that leak out into the area around the statues, sometimes taking on physical substance. Though Imbrex has remained silent on the subject, many First World residents—including other Eldest—believe that when the Statue Lords finally deign to walk, it will be to bring about the end of both the First World and the Material Plane, unmaking them both in order to usher in the next phase of creation."

The innumerable tiny pouches and glass vials that hang from a sash around her waist are rumored to contain cures to every malady known to mortals. The soothing empyreal lord's right arm is not flesh, but a knotty length of pine carved in the shape of an arm with long, capable-looking fingers at its end. Balm-Bringer is a healer on the eternal battlefields of the planes, where she nurses injured angels back to health and soothes the wounds of empyreal lords who clashed with the armies of evil and destruction. Her favored servants travel the mortal world, passing on herbal remedies and advice on how best to tend potent marsh plants, all the while teaching combat medics and battlefield healers the best techniques to ensure their warriors live to fight another day. Balm-Bringer also understands that some cannot be healed. For them, she provides ointments that take away the pain and grant peace until life's final moments.

Rather than cause loss of life directly, their machinations precede large disasters, though as the penultimate usher of order, they also arrange for disasters when mortal cultures are too slow in dying. A compulsion buried deep within Imot compels them to hide clues to every disaster in the natural world before the event transpires, wrapped in confounding symbolism and boggling equations. These vague hints and hidden meanings inspire anxiety in most mortal minds. To those unaware of the true nature of these premonitions, this takes the form of subconscious unease; to those aware of the usher’s omens, these clues provide a means of averting disaster that is often found far too late. Because of this, Imot is also the usher of dread, paranoia, self-blame for unavoidable disasters, and the omnipresent fear of personal failing. Imot’s nature makes them the natural patron of mathematicians—especially those who press the boundaries of mortal understanding—and the bearer of souls that perished due to seemingly inevitable ends or that died en masse. People plagued with uneasy premonitions, be they true glimpses of impending tragedy or simply figments of the mind, are sometimes drawn toward the worship of Imot. Prophets who seek accurate omens in an age of lost prophecy are drawn to Imot’s complex and hidden portents, seeking to painstakingly unravel the usher’s hidden clues to look into the future. The Symbol of Doom’s own predictions aren’t divine in nature, however, and are simply the result of their own infinitely complex calculations. Imot manifests as a golden, four-sided pyramid with a wing sprouting from each of their facets. They have great difficulty expressing themselves verbally and instead conjure images and symbols to communicate."

He is capable of striding the gulfs between planets on icy winds to visit any world that might catch his interest, yet his explorations and influence over the worlds he treads upon seem to be curiously limited in scope to those regions above each world’s arctic circle. He can, for short periods of time, venture south, but never for long, and his touch is unknown in the southern reaches of these worlds. Yet in his realm, he is greatly feared, for cannibalism and the monstrous creatures known as wendigos are rampant in the times before and after his visits. Ithaqua often takes a personal interest in certain souls, be they worshipers or unbelievers. He takes these folk into the skies and may even bring them to other worlds, yet his purpose in these abductions is unclear, for those who walk with Ithaqua always meet the same fate—a devastating fall from a great height resulting in either death in some frozen wilderness or transformation into a wendigo and the loss of all memories of a previous life. Ithaqua is known by many names in icy regions. He appears humanoid in form, yet his limbs are long and gaunt, and his feet are often concealed in gusts and blasts of blizzard winds. When he visits, despite these winds that surround him, he leaves monstrous tracks in the snow that show webbing between the toes. Those who gaze upon the Wind-Walker often don’t remember his shape at all, only the two points of light—so like strange sparkling stars in the night sky—that are in fact his eyes. \nNote that while Ithaqua does not grant the domain of Water, his followers can take the subdomain of Ice."

Jerishall recognizes that asteroids, meteors, and other planets can crash into a species’ home world, yet they do not condone the utter destruction of such threats. Instead, Jerishall encourages the development of astronomy, astrophysics, and technology to redirect such missiles or allow large populations to escape their planet entirely. As a result, the Turning Sphere is an indirect patron of space travel, earning them the respect of spacefaring creatures such as witchwyrds and even elder things. Jerishall is especially wary of the ways in which the Outer Planes and Inner Planes interact, preferring each plane’s isolated physics to prevail rather than for an encroaching realm’s influence to alter the other’s orbits and processes.

Many religious texts point to the werewolf Jezelda as the first to spread lycanthropy among the mortals of the world, but strangely, neither she nor her faithful support that claim; instead they remain strangely silent upon her history, as if they shared a secret that the world is not yet meant to know. As the patron of werewolves, Jezelda is herself a shapechanger. She can appear as a beautiful and darkhaired Varisian woman, a feral and slavering wolf with huge fangs and yellow eyes, or her favored form—that of an emaciated amalgamation of these two embodiments, also bearing a pair of demonic horns. She despises non-werewolf lycanthropes, and charges her worshipers with seeking out such creatures as heretics worthy only for sacrifice. Goodaligned lycanthropes in particular raise Jezelda’s ire, and such a sacrifice almost always curries her favor. Jezelda’s realm on the Abyss is known as the Moonbog. This vast realm is large enough to contain a single glowing moon high above—the “stars” in the night sky are said to be the eyes of her favored wolf consorts looking down upon the realm below. Below, the Moonbog consists of vast stretches of moorland separated by winding wetlands of bogs and fens infested with all manner of monstrous denizens—the deeper and more remote of these bogs are often ruled by powerful hezrous or half-fiend froghemoths. Yet it is on the moors themselves where the true dangers of this realm can be found—for it is here that Jezelda and her favored consorts hunt under the wan light of the moon. These moors are populated by isolated communities of humanoids harvested from countless worlds. Jezelda enjoys moving from one village to the other, constantly hunting while her minions work furiously to abduct and repopulate the realm behind her so she need never be faced with an empty realm."

Yet despite the Faceless Lord’s lack of interest in his faithful, he certainly knows of the Material Plane and enjoys absorbing the bodies of unwilling mortals into his protoplasmic bulk. Jubilex appears as a shapeless green mass of ooze shot through with dark ribbons of tar and hundreds of glaring red eyes the size of a man’s head. His realm on the Abyss is called the Undersump, and consists of a tangled warren of sewer-like catacombs and tunnels that winds below dozens of other Abyssal realms—many creatures use the Undersump as a method of covertly moving from one such realm to the other, but they must take care to avoid Jubilex’s awareness when they do. Of course, Jubilex’s wanderings and attention to the regions of the Undersump are basically random, and certain parts of the realm are so rarely visited by the Faceless Lord that other strange and dangerous creatures have claimed them."

Khepri is the god of the rising sun in the eastern horizon, and the scarab rolling a ball of dung across the ground is seen as a symbol of Khepri pushing the sun across the sky. As the sun rises in the morning, so do the peasants who work all day with little reward, and Khepri is their divine embodiment, promising freedom from toil and reward for their labor in the afterlife. He is also a mischievous prankster, breaking up the tedium of the long days with his antics and poking fun at those who consider themselves the commoners' betters. Khepri is typically represented as a scarab beetle, or as a man with a scarab beetle for a head. As a solar deity, Khepri works closely with Ra and Horus, is friendly with Hathor, and is opposed to Apep and Set and their evil machinations. As a trickster, Khepri is close friends with Bes, and he relishes the distaste that his strange appearance, his pungent aroma, and all that he represents elicit in more refined and civilized gods such as Bastet, Maat, and Thoth. Khepri seldom has dedicated temples, but as the patron of peasants, his priests can be found anywhere the common folk labor. Temporary shrines to the scarab god often spring up next to fields or at building sites, where workers make small offerings of a bite of their food or a sip of their beer, and ask Khepri to grant them an easy and productive day of work."

Korada's holy symbol has several incarnations based on the viewer's region and the local ideals of enlightenment and peace, though the most common representation is that of two kneeling figures before a lotus. Many who are weary from a lifetime of imbalance or violence turn to Korada in search of peace. Retired soldiers, their hands stained with blood, lay down their weapons forever in the name of this empyreal lord. Likewise, diplomats in strange lands, individuals facing difficult moral choices, and champions of evil who long for absolution all find comfort in the teachings of the OpenHand of Harmony. While true repentance is necessary for evil to turn to good, Korada believes that no mortals are beyond redemption. Korada is said to possess the gift of foresight, but he rarely acts on these strange visions. He believes the struggle to change is always worthwhile, even if such a journey does not always end in success. It is the process, not the result, that matters most to Korada and his followers. When he is not teaching lessons of harmony to his devotees, Korada resides in Nirvana, in the heart of the Dream Lotus-an efflorescent palace whose blossoming violet walls always drip with cool, golden nectar that is said to calm even the wildest of spirits."

Shortly thereafter, Cayden Cailean and Desna raised Kurgess to godhood, crowning him with deific powers.

He assures orcs of their inherent superiority over all other humanoids, and over most other creatures as well. The Slavelord does not believe in peers, teaching that in all relationships one party is superior to the other. An orc must know his place in the pecking order, but he must never be satisfied unless he’s at the top. For a follower of Lanishra, it’s better to be feared than loved, for only those who can dominate others deserve to lead. Lanishra is depicted as an orc chieftain, richly attired (for an orc), but armed for a fight. His favored weapon is the war flail—a mockery of the farmer’s tool, unsuitable for threshing grain but ideal for flaying those who disobey him or deign to think themselves his better. Lanishra teaches that a warrior’s job is to excel at warfare and that manual labor is beneath him. The reward for a warrior’s work is the free acquisition of the goods produced by those he conquers—both from their past labors and those carried out under his whip. Lanishra’s philosophy is most at odds with those of Nulgreth and Zagresh, who would rather kill than enslave. Yet his fiercest rival is Verex, whose desire for slaves equals the Slavelord’s; despite their shared goal, the two rarely get along. Tribes dedicated to Lanishra are heavily involved in the slave trade, though even tribes devoted to other gods may have priests of the Slavelord to oversee their chattel. Many orc chieftains promote the worship of Lanishra, as his teachings legitimize their rule and supremacy."

Ancient Osirians believed that the legitimacy and efficacy of a pharaoh's reign were dependent on upholding the concepts embodied by Maat, and to prevent the universe from dissolving into chaos, this order must be constantly renewed and preserved by both humans and the gods. Maat is the daughter of Ra, sister of Bastet, Hathor, and Sekhmet, and the wife of Thoth. Maat presides over the councils of the gods, being impartial, honest, and fair, and she assists Pharasma in the judgment of souls as they pass on into the afterlife. As the upholder of cosmic order, Maat is opposed to both Set and Apep, who work to bring about chaos and entropy. Maat usually appears as a woman with a blue ostrich feather on her head. She is often depicted with winged arms, holding an ankh and a was scepter, symbols of life and power, respectively. Her sacred animal is the leopard, because the pattern on its coat represents the stars in the night sky. Paladins often worship Maat as the embodiment of justice, and monks and oracles revere the cosmic truth she embodies."

She is a seer among seers, the mother of paradox, and even the other Eldest sometimes beseech her for interpretations of her maddeningly opaque visions, for it’s said that in her forest pools Magdh has glimpsed the ends of all things, including the Eldest themselves. Magdh, often known simply as the Three, takes the form of a robed humanoid woman with three faces set equidistantly around her head, the hair framing those faces by turns black, red, and blonde. These faces swivel to address the object of her attention at seemingly random intervals, sometimes mid-sentence, spinning her head in complete circles without apparent ill effect. Though not actually a collective consciousness like Shyka, Madgh’s faces appear to represent different aspects of her personality, though not always the same one—a supplicant who notices the red-haired face radiating maternal affection in one interaction might attempt to curry favor with it the next time, only to find it personifying rage or humor. When necessary, Magdh has even been known to split into three separate women in order to accomplish some task, yet the Eldest often seems reserved or less lucid for a time following such separations."

At the center, a sickening clot of wriggling hair boils around a roughly spherical body, the only concession toward a “front” being an immense spider’s mouth filled with thrashing pedipalps and fangs. Mazmezz has the insidious ability to wrap herself in gauzy, vexing swaths of webbing that can magically alter her form to anything she can imagine—the form of a beautiful woman or female drider is a particular favorite when she’s dealing with those she might wish to capture and keep as trophies for her horrific harem. Yet when forced to punish foes or do battle, the Creeping Queen always reverts to her nauseating true form. Mazmezz is worshiped primarily by drow, driders, and ettercaps, but some particularly demented humanoids worship her as well—these tend to be isolated admirers rather than members of full-blown cults. Her hive-like Abyssal domain is known as Khavak-Vog, and its tangled ways are the lair of her favored children, the bebiliths. The core of her maze-like lair is guarded by several of these fiends grown to great size. Legend holds that the first bebiliths were spawned by Mazmezz; if true, this would explain the disgust and hatred with which most other demon lords hold the Creeping Queen."

His symbols are rarely seen, however, as owing one's allegiance to Mephistopheles is most often kept secret. Simpler, alternative versions of his unholy symbol exist, including a red sun eclipsed by three mountains; a tongue pierced with three studs; and a scale surmounted with a feather, topped by a bone. The latter evokes Mephistopheles' three sets of wings. Mephistopheles originated as the consciousness of Hell itself, predating Asmodeus' discovery of the plane. When Asmodeus and his followers entered Hell following their Exodus from Heaven, Asmodeus traveled into Caina and tore Hell's very flesh from its bones, reshaping it into a being he named Mephistopheles. The newly formed entity, the first true devil, pledged to oppose Asmodeus' enemies as if they were its own, and became one of Asmodeus' closest lieutenants. This story is recorded in the Book of the Damned."

Those who survive often receive visits decades later from twisted and hideous half-fiends—their sons or daughters, sent by Mestama to finish off the job and murder their fathers. Mestama’s cult is a hateful one, composed entirely of eunuchs or women who live for the spread of cruelty through deception. Her cultists generally regard competing faiths (such as worshipers of Gyronna) with jealous anger. The Mother of Witches dwells in an Abyssal realm called the Barren Wood, a vexing forest of dead and dying pine and fir trees. Decrepit houses serve witches and hags as dens or traps, and darker creatures haunt the more desolate reaches of the wood. Certain remote forests in Avistan (particularly in Nidal, Taldor, and Galt) are said to connect to the Barren Wood—those who unknowingly wander too deeply into these areas can become lost forever."

The attempt to manifest failed for unknown reasons; perhaps the alignment of the planets was not right, or perhaps other entities acted to still the birth before it came to term. Yet Mhar’s cult believes not that their god failed to be born, but rather that its gestation is merely one measured in eons. The cult further believes that the time for Mhar’s birth draws near, and that when the Great Old One—said to dwell deep under the tallest mountain in the Inner Sea region, a peak in the Kodar Mountains known as Mhar Massif—finally wakens, it will transform much of northern Avistan into a new realm of fire and ash that will spread across world. The time of this birth, the cult believes, can be predicted by a sudden increase in the number of violent, fatal earthquakes and sudden instances of volcanism throughout the world, and some of Mhar’s more powerful worshipers seek to hasten that birth by triggering their own tectonic disasters in key places. Mhar’s true shape is unknown, for the deity technically has yet to enter existence. In images created by its cult, the Great Old One is generally depicted as a volcano-shaped leviathan, its caldera surrounded by huge fangs of molten lava and its slopes bearing forests of terrifying, razorsharp crystal limbs."

Her symbol is a rose growing out of a blood-soaked street. Until the death of Aroden in 4606 AR, the goddess Milani was simply one of dozens of saints within the Last Azlanti's faith. She was the beacon of hope to all those who fought against repressive regimes, giving courage to those who had little but their desire to live a free life. The death of her patron, combined with the tremendous upheaval and suffering that followed his death, gave her a focus and attracted many new followers. Those devoted to her found the courage to organize the rebellions against the infernal takeover of the Chelish Empire, helping many of her outlying territories break free of its control. They fought against the slow slide into barbarism, restoring people's hope that a just and good society could be restored. Milani has never been as popular as Aroden's other followers,such as Iomedae, perhaps because the Inheritor's worship had already been firmly established before their patron's passing. Milani has two realms: Milani's Garden in Elysium, where she spends most of her time, and the Refuge of the Red Rose in Axis, a small corner located within the collapsing divine realm of Aroden. Only a few square miles in size, the Refuge of the Red Rose sits near the center of her former patron's realm. From here she gives aid to all those fighting oppression and evil, strives to mitigate the institutionalised inequality in Axis, and seeks to relocate the downtrodden to friendlier places."

It is intrinsically without form, operating almost exclusively through the host of aeons for which it is the guiding force, originating spirit, and nexus of thought. In fact, due to the way the Monad creates, reabsorbs, and reshapes the aeons’ quintessence, it behaves as much like a plane as a deity, seeming to exist and act outside even the cycle of souls. To aeons, the Monad isn’t merely an expression of the void that predated the cosmos, creation itself, the future infinity, and the truth that binds existence: it actually is all of those things. The Monad’s goals appear fixated on the cosmic status quo. On one hand, the entity seems content so long as the planes are in balance with each other. On the other hand, countless aeons seem to police the multiverse and sustain it based on some inscrutable model that most other beings describe as slightly out of sync with the gods’ designs. Some have speculated that the Monad isn’t simply reality’s figurative immune system but rather is from a previous existence that it aims to recreate with subtle nudges that interact with the present reality’s needs in alien ways. The Monad is an unlikely divine patron. Without approaching the level of detachment and selflessness of an aeon, a mortal worshipper cannot hope to connect with the Monad on anything more than a philosophical level. However, a rare few can tap into the Condition of All, experiencing flashes of insight and wordless directives as if these contemplatives were fledgling aeons. It is unclear if the Monad is even cognizant of its worshippers, though as long as a priest remains centered, honors its vague orders, and works to maintain balance, she can draw upon her patron for spellcasting and even greater boons."

In cities where such grotesqueries would cause incident, his worshipers wear heavy cloaks and silver masks to hide their shapes. Mordiggian’s temples are grand mausoleum-cathedrals placed in positions of prominence in their cities. Cities that host such temples have no graveyards of their own, for the priests of Mordiggian collect the bodies of the dead and place them, free of charge, into their sacred vaults for “disposal.” As such, undead and corpse-borne disease are rare contagions in cities under Mordiggian’s care, yet sometimes his priests are too eager in gathering the “dead,” and have been known to take away those in comas or deathlike trances from which they could have recovered. Mordiggian is a living cloud of darkness, capable of congealing and coalescing all or portions of his form within the inky depths to serve his needs, whether he’s manifesting a long, grasping limb to pluck a ripened morsel from a coffin-platter, or visiting his wrath upon those who dare to tread upon halls where only the dead may walk. The Charnel God’s favored form is that of an immense worm with a set of grasping tentacles arrayed around a central maw; this fanged maw appears often in the god’s symbology."

He carries a basket of fresh fruit or flowers in one hand, and his rusted greatsword, Ardor, in the other. He maintains his realm, the Garden Anima, among Pharasma’s Court as a quiet refuge for souls who need time to reflect and talk after particularly traumatic deaths.

They reflect personal choices, sacrifice of self, and countless little deaths that come before a soul finally arrives in the Boneyard. They understand that a broken thing—especially one repaired—is not less valuable but simply different, and sometimes even more precious for the history it now embodies. In mortals, such personal change is difficult and almost always accompanied by physical and emotional pain, and many souls wind up straddling two extremes or failing to complete their transformation before they die. The Cleansing Sentence offers such souls the option to endure terrible pain or perform onerous tasks to prove their commitment to redemption or damnation. They are also the psychopomp who judges good mortals driven to terrible deeds by their beliefs and convictions and tests their mettle to see where their souls truly belong. Narakaas represents the acceptance of pain and the growth it fosters; they don’t revel in pain, and entities that do—such as kytons—are anathema to the Cleansing Sentence.

She is occasionally depicted wearing armor, and always carries a bow and arrows. Hunters, rangers, sailors, smiths, soldiers, and warriors all worship Neith as their patron. Clerics of Neith are usually skilled smiths or weavers, or both, and like their goddess, they do not marry."

In particular, Nephthys is the guardian of the lungs and the canopic jar that contains them. As her husband and brother Set is the god of darkness and deserts, Nephthys is the goddess of night and the edge of the desert, the border between civilization and wilderness. Nephthys is the sister oflsis and Osiris and the sister-wife of Set. Following Osiris's murder at the hands of Set, Nephthys grieved along with Isis, and helped her sister gather the scattered pieces of Osiris's dismembered body. She also nursed and protected the young Horus. Although she is Set's wife, Nephthys does not normally support her husband, instead siding with Isis and Osiris in most conflicts . Having conceived no children with Set, Nephthys plied Osiris with wine and seduced him, later giving birth to a son, Anubis. Nephthys appears as a woman with winged arms wearing a headdress in the shape of a basket atop a tower-a representation of the hieroglyphic symbol ofher name, and also her holy symbol. Nephthys does not usually have temples of her own, though she is often repre sented in churches of Anubis, Isis, and Osiris, or more rarely, alongside her husband Set in his temples. These small shrines are available for worshipers to leave their goddess small offerings and offer her prayers. Clerics of Nephthys assist other priests at funerals and work as professional mourners, even working closely with the church of Pharasma when needed."

As with every traveler met on a lonely road far from civilization, the Lord of the Crossroads is an enigma. While many Eldest and gods like Norgorber concern themselves with secrets, Ng’s are perhaps the greatest, as even his most steadfast worshipers have no idea what he truly is, nor what ends he might be pursuing. Indeed, the Hooded rarely acknowledges his worshipers at all, leading some to question whether he’s actually responsible for granting spells to those who pray to him. Ng’s seemingly aimless wanderings and inscrutable questions have led to many theories about his nature. Some paint him as a ghost, the shade of some forgotten Eldest too powerful to abandon the First World entirely. Others cite his endless patience and logic as those of a clockwork automaton, a servant of whatever distant being created the Palace of Seasons, or perhaps even the mouthpiece through which a departed god maintains a hand in the plane’s affairs. Still others believe him to be the voice of the First World itself, the avatar of a vast emergent consciousness. Ng has heard all of these theories, and met them with stoic silence. Whatever his nature or motives, they remain solidly and silently his own—a fitting response for a lord of secrets."

Yet this river, as with any river, is not wholly without peril. Predators hunt the metaphysical banks and depths of the River of Souls, eager to pluck out and devour drifting souls before they can be sent on to their final rewards. Mysterious Nhimbaloth feeds upon those predators, and revels in the digestion of souls already being digested in the gullets of those who would deem themselves the hunters of the dead. Nhimbaloth’s presence is most often felt in tangled swamps, desolate shorelines, or remote stretches of river. Her cultists hold that will-o’-wisps are her eyes and believe that the fear one endures when one knows death is near is her breath. While those who die know grief and pain, their souls can one day go on to be something greater. But those touched by Nhimbaloth know only the agony of death. They do not go on. They simply end. The Empty Death is shapeless, yet evidence of her presence can be seen in the tortured, faceless undead that often haunt places she has brushed against. Wildlife grows more antagonistic in these areas, and plants grow strangely hateful to the eye and eager to tear the flesh. Strange markings on riverbanks or island shores—clusters of seven perfectly spaced divots of crumbling dry earth—are thought to be her fingerprints. Where Nhimbaloth has hunted, the world itself recoils."

The Blood God is credited with giving orcs their innate ferocity, which when kindled like an ember becomes an uncontrollable inferno of rage. Nulgreth eschews ranged combat, preferring to look his opponents in the eyes and feel their blood splatter on him as he kills them. He makes no complex schemes or long-term plans. He knows only bloodlust, and through his gifts of strength and rage, he impels orcs to wage bloody warfare across Golarion. Nulgreth is depicted as an orc barbarian with bloodred skin. Indeed, most images of Nulgreth are painted in blood; devotees color themselves so to emulate the Blood God, using red ochre when fresh blood isn’t available. Nulgreth is always in the throes of rage. Though none question his prowess in battle, Nulgreth’s need for immediate gratification often conflicts with the carefully considered plans of his brothers Lanishra, Sezelrian, and Varg. All orcs revere Nulgreth as the source of their ferocity, but his worship is especially popular among barbarians. Like their patron, tribes dedicated to the Blood God are excessively violent in battle. Not satisfied merely to kill their enemies, these orcs disembowel the corpses and bathe in the blood. These tribes rarely keep slaves; an enemy who survives combat is soon sacrificed in a bloody ritual. Though Nulgreth does not grant the Destruction domain, his clerics can take the Rage subdomain because of the god’s close association with that violent emotion."

His lower body is that of a golden lion with a draconic tail. His torso is deeply tanned and masculine, and he is rarely seen without a heavy mace, the head of which appears to be a miniature sun, held in one four-fingered, taloned hand. His head is that of a lion as well, and blinding light spews from his eyes and mouth. Nurgal’s faith was quite strong in ancient Azlant, and not a few Azlanti ruins bear evidence of this connection in carvings that depict a fanged mouth around a sun or the presence of lion-like monsters. Today, his worship has lessened, and is limited to the deserts of northern Garund, Qadira, and ruined Ninshabur. His Abyssal realm is known as Kuthan, an expansive region of alternating desert and dry savannas under a vast red sun that never moves from its noontime height above. Narrow gorges hundreds of miles long connect Kuthan to its neighboring realm, the Sea of Whispering Sands, where Nurgal’s lover, Areshkagal, used to rule before being banished to the Blood Clefts by her sister. Nurgal is also believed to be the half-brother of Socothbenoth, but this relationship is not friendly, and the two have been at war for as long as they both have existed."

Some believe that it was Nyarlathotep’s advice that moved Taldor to launch the Armies of Exploration that ultimately presaged that nation’s fall from glory, and that led the dwarves of Dongun Hold to invent the first firearm. Certainly his influence can be seen in the troubled history of Osirion, a culture he seems particularly interested in. Nyarlathotep’s forms are each associated with their own distinct cults.

She tracks the passage of power-and the responsibilities such power brings with it-from parent to child, ruler to heir, and dynasty to dynasty. Whether power transfers legitimately through inheritance or election or forcibly through coup or rebellion, Olheon sees the change and judges accordingly. The Just Arbiter is among the most magnificent empyreal lords to behold. Olheon stands over 16 feet tall, towering over most mortals, and her blue eyes blaze in a face of burnished gold. She wears a heavy silver breastplate and greaves, but her gauntleted hands and forearms are stained crimson, as if she had plunged her armored fists into pools of fresh blood. In one hand she carries a ruby-bladed halberd even taller than herself; in the other hand, she bears a heavy golden seal of office affirming her charge. Olheon despises tyrants and boils at the sight of legitimate rulers who, through weakness or ignorance, cause hardship and unjust living conditions for those under their dominion. She works through her subjects and divine minions to teach those who can be taught and to punish those who cannot. Officials, noble rulers, and even parents all look to Olheon for guidance, and they are in turn judged according to their actions. Olheon occupies the northern wing of the Courts of Accord, where the magicals crying mirrors hung in her vast Hall of Thrones displays cenes of accession and rulership throughout the multiverse."

The superstitious orcs believe that the names of gods hold power, and to speak a god’s name is to draw its attention. Orcs may revere violent gods, not even they wish to see the full manifestation of such deities’ destructive power. Only the shamans and witch doctors dare speak these unholy names, and then only in the midst of ecstatic rituals.

His cultists maintain that the Prince of Undeath is merely waiting for matters in other worlds to resolve themselves before turning his gaze upon this world as his next prize—and that when he does, his faithful shall be rightly rewarded for preparing the way. Of course, fierce competition for worshipers with the cults of Zura and Kabriri and the church of Urgathoa is a more likely reason why Orcus’s cult on Golarion isn’t more widespread. Orcus appears as an immense, fat humanoid with a ram’s head, bat-like wings, cloven feet, and a long tail ending in a stinger. His legendary weapon, the Wand of Orcus, is never far from his taloned hand. His Abyssal realm of Uligor is an entire world of undead-haunted ruins, frozen seas, ragged mountains, and hideous deserts and swamps. Orcus shares this realm with a large number of evil thanatotic titans, not all of whom worship or even ally with the Prince of Undeath. Large regions of Uligor are scarred by the unending civil war between the titans. It is unknown what shadowy force directly opposes Orcus on Uligor, but his war with this mysterious demigod has lasted for millennia."

Similar in appearance and consistency to crude oil, this black blood is freezing cold to the touch, yet bolsters and invigorates undead flesh. It was within these un-waters that the race known as the charda were spawned, and first among their kind was the Faceless God, Orgesh. Orgesh no longer dwells in the Land of Black Blood, having abandoned its children to that realm. Although they still worship it, generations of neglect have had a positive effect on the charda—they retain their unpredictable ways, yet are no longer driven by cruelty and vengeful hunger. Those who remember but do not venerate Orgesh believe the Faceless God abandoned its children for others found far to the west in the deepest, darkest trenches of the Sightless Sea. Orgesh has no organized cult, and its followers see each other as the greatest threat. Some believe that by consuming the flesh and bones of a fellow devotee of the Faceless God, one can take in that devotee’s faith, and that when but one worshiper remains, Orgesh will return to use this final fanatic to unleash a new race upon the vaults of Orv—a race that may not stop its expansion until all has been consumed. None alive has looked upon Orgesh, yet statues of it remain strangely impervious to erosion, and thus provide evidence of its visage, or lack thereof. These statues depict Orgesh as a vaguely humanoid figure with a hugely distended belly, clawed and doglike legs, and an open mouth filled with shark’s teeth, but with no other facial features whatsoever."

Isis gathered up the pieces, and using her magic, she brought her husband back to life. Now free from death, Osiris became a god of death and life after death, whose resurrection mirrors the rebirth of souls in the afterlife. Osiris is also a fertility god, a deity of nature and growth who dies each year with the harvest and is reborn again in the spring when vegetation sprouts again. Osiris always appears wrapped up like a mummy, but with green skin symbolizing his role as a god of fertility. He wears a white atef crown with two ostrich feathers and carries a crook and flail, the symbols of pharaonic rule. Osiris is the brother of Nephthys and Set. His sister Isis is also his wife, and he is the father of Horus. As a death god, Osiris is tightly aligned with the likes of Pharasma and Anubis, but his brother Set remains his sworn enemy."

Where her predictions encounter anomalies, she dispatches teams of outsiders—or, rarely, mortals—to investigate, report back, and even correct the disturbance directly.

Otolmens regularly submits reports to a host of deities, summarizing her findings and the means by which she intends to correct the errors. After millions of such dispatches, these reports are largely formalities—not only because the divine host has largely grown inured to these messages, but also because there’s little a divinity might say in response that would discourage her.

His breath is a cloud of locusts, and it is said that at the dawn of civilization his first breath of air upon the Material Plane spawned the demon that, in time, would become Deskari. Pazuzu is among the oldest of the demon lords, one of the first to rise to power in the Abyss long ago alongside the likes of Lamashtu, Abraxas, and Dagon, yet his long conf lictwith Lamashtu has prevented him from achieving greater power or perhaps even godhood himself—a fact that only serves to spur his unending conflict with the Mother of Monsters. Pazuzu’s Abyssal realm of High M’Vania exists on the side of one of the great Abyssal rifts. This vertical realm includes an immense city on a vast shelf, as well as the depths below it and the skies above. The unique location of this realm allows Pazuzu unprecedented mobility among the Outer Planes, a freedom he often abuses in his war against Lamashtu, recruiting powerful allies from Hell, Abaddon, and beyond. Pazuzu’s personal rookery is a tangle of towers called Shibaxet—a place only his most trusted minions or his favored meals ever get to see."

Pharasma saw this form of immortality as fundamental to mortal experience and raised Phlegyas up to be a patron both of art outlasting its creator and of those who spurned the gods. As a symbol of creations outliving their creators, she is also the usher of new parents, especially those who die in childbirth. Unlike Shelyn’s domain of beauty, the Consoler of Atheists embodies resonance, and the works Phlegyas inspires are as often painful or horrifying as they are beautiful. Time and perspective cooled Phlegyas’s resentment of the divine, and now she and her servants offer respite to atheists who arrive at the Boneyard. Those godless souls who show potential she reserves to train as psychopomps. Phlegyas is the most human of the ushers: a tall, broadshouldered woman wearing a simple, plaster domino mask and carrying an oar she uses to ferry those who spurn the call of their gods. Her realm is the Anonymous Loggia, a museum of works by long-forgotten creators that still remain linchpins in mortal cultures."

He can take any form that best suits his capers, but when he appears to mortals, he typically does so as a young boy with brown skin and wildly curling black hair. His delicate features, graceful limbs, and pointed ears suggest elven ancestry, and he is never seen without his telltale woven wool vest dyed bright green and yellow and worked with images of llamas, tree frogs, and snakes. Good folk who look at the world with wonder and delight often pay homage to Picoperi. Inventors, particularly alchemists who use ingredients derived from jungle plants, sometimes let Picoperi's love of surprises guide them to new discoveries. Picoperi takes great delight in taunting the forces of evil. In battle, he prefers ambushes and traps over forward charges, and he poisons his victims with darts that cause uncontrollable laughter and dreamy euphoria. Legend tells that thousands of years ago, Urxehl smiled at one of Picoperi's jokes, and the demon lord has sought to destroy the merry trickster ever since. Picoperi lives in the heart of a kapok tree on Elysium. Though the tree looks small from the outside, the inside holds a network of comfortable rooms carved into the tree's trunk."

Such is Ptah's creative power that alone among the ancient Osirian gods, he created himself. He is the fire beneath the earth, and earthquakes and tremors are said to be signs of his disfavor. Ptah is the husband of Sekhmet, and an ally of Ra and Maat. Although he normally remains aloof from divine politics, he has come into conflict with Apep and Set when those gods attempt to destroy his creations. Ptah normally appears as a man wearing the wrappings of a mummy, with a simple skullcap on his head, and holding a staff in his hands composed of three combined symbols of his creative power-the ankh, representing life; the djed pillar, signifying stability; and the was scepter, symbolizing power. At other times, Ptah is depicted as a naked and deformed dwarf, and it is in this form that the Pahmet dwarves of Osirion venerate him. Ptah is the patron of alchemists, architects, artisans, artists, bards, builders, carpenters, masons, metalworkers, shipbuilders, and anyone else who is involved in creative endeavors. Additionally, Ptah is said to hear the prayers of all mortal worshipers, and he often intercedes with the other gods on behalf of humanity."

Pulura was worshiped as a major deity in the lost Kellid realm of Sarkoris. The Sarkorians saw her and the demon lord Kostchtchie as dualistic gods of cold. She was honoured by a mighty ring of idols in the city of Dyinglight but, in common with the rest of Sarkoris, the city fell to the demons of the Worldwound. A cascade named for her, Pulura's Fall, once flowed to the northeast of Iz; it has since been swallowed by the Worldwound, but its namesake, a temple to Pulura, remains, and has been withstanding a demonic siege for more than a century. An idol to Pulura stands on the Walk of Lost Gods in the ravaged town of Gundrun.   \nAppearance: Pulura appears as a lovely, alluring Tian woman with the grace of a dancer, a gravity about her expression, and black, flowing hair gleaming with the light of stars. Her robes appear to be made from green and pink light, and flicker with every one of her movements. She often appears dancing amid the aurora borealis in the skies of far northern lands, and legend has it that her extraordinary beauty will burn any mortals who dare approach her too closely. She wields a sling made from sighs that fires bullets of starlight."

He created most of the ancient Osirian gods and ruled as their king during the Age of Creation. The ancient Osirians believed they were created from Ra's tears, and like the sun, Ra watches over all the earth and his creations. Ra is the ruler of the heavens, a deity of kings and royalty. He represents fair and just rule in accordance with the principles ofhonor and truth. Ra is depicted as a powerful man with the head of a falcon and a blazing solar disk above his head. He is the father of Bastet, Hathor, Maat, and Sekhmet, though he created many of the other Osirian gods as well. His archenemy is Apep, and every night Ra must defend the sun against the great serpent who seeks to consume it. That the sun rises in the morning is seen as proof of Ra's victory over the Devourer of the Dawn. Kings and pharaohs worship Ra as their patron, as do paladins and warriors battling against the forces of darkness. As the god of the sun, Ra is also venerated by commoners and farmers. Ra's temples are open to the sky and decorated with obelisks representing petrified sun's rays, and services are held in daylight under Ra's watchful eye."

Fond of titles, he is also called the Serpent King, the Water Lord, and even the Father of Dragons. This last is considered heretical by most metallic and chromatic dragons, yet many linnorms pay homage to him as their progenitor, and few of the great dragons—or anyone else—would dare enter the First World’s deep seas and oceans without his permission. Ragadahn himself resembles an enormous, streamlined linnorm with flippers instead of legs, his scales a deep, shimmering blue-green. While his home is the deep trench-city of Karaphas, he claims all of the seas and lakes of the First World—and, to some extent, of the Material Plane—as his personal realm. All creatures who live in or enter deep waters are thus subject to his authority, though in truth he cares little for the dealings of ordinary fey or mortals, and few ever glimpse his majesty. That said, any land-dwellers wishing to speak with him are best advised to call his name from a sea cliff or peninsula rather than approach his home directly, lest they be accused of trespassing. Most stories of the Water Lord tend to caricature him as the epitome of draconic arrogance, yet these are quick to note his wisdom as well—for despite his tempestuous nature, Ragadahn is a consummate scholar of the unknown and unknowable. He believes that life first arose in the oceans, and that the secrets to eternity and existence remain in their depths. He’s fond of symbolism, particularly the unending ouroboros and the ever-descending spiral, and behind his fearsome facade lies a keen mind and a wealth of knowledge regarding extinct aquatic cultures from across the planes."

His portfolio includes chivalry, duty, and vengeance, and his holy symbol is a bastard sword crossed with a crimson wing. He makes his home at the base of the mountain of Heaven, in his eponymous fortress, a magnificent steel structure designed to withstand a thousand-year siege if need be. Ragathiel takes an active role in the battle against Hell's fiendish legions. He shines at the head of his army, a figure of golden light cleaving through the ranks of devils that face him. Soldiers of all kinds, but particularly knights, pay homage to Ragathiel and pray for his virtue and wrathful strength in battle. Those who have taken vows, especially those of duty or vengeance, hold Ragathiel as their ideal, and his agents sometimes assist those who have been grievously wronged and now seek righteous vengeance. As strange as it may seem, Ragathiel is the son of Feronia, a demigoddess of the Plane of Fire, and Dispater, the Father of Dis. He was conceived in a brief tryst (lasting only a few centuries), after which his mother took him out of Hell. Ragathiel's tainted heritage has left him with a wrathful heart, and the angel struggles constantly to master his baser impulses in service to the light. For thousands of years he strove to prove himself to the angelic choirs of Heaven. In the Maelstrom he wrestled for 16 years with a monstrous evil serpent whose scales wept acidic blood until he was able to choke the life out of it. He led an entire army against one of the iron fortresses of Avernus and burned the castle to the ground with holy fire, single-handedly maiming Infernal Duke Deumus in the process. Finally the other empyreal lords agreed to admit Ragathiel into their ranks, and now they appear to trust the angel completely—though that trust took centuries to develop. At some point in history, Ragathiel destroyed Typhon, the original ruler of the first layer of Hell.He may have been manipulated into doing so by the schemes of Asmodeus to punish Typhon for his indiscretions.[9] Ragathiel was once served by the Hand of the Inheritor, an angel who now acts as the goddess Iomedae's herald. Then known as the Hand of Vengeance, this angel asked to be reassigned to Iomedae after the death of Aroden. \nAppearance: Ragathiel is a tower of glorious might. He stands almost 20 feet tall, and five lofty burning wings stretch from his back. The General of Vengeance once had six wings, but one was severed, torn from his body by the archdevil Dispater—Ragathiel's father.   \nWorship: Ragathiel is commonly worshiped by the avowed, knights, soldiers, the wronged, and the empyreal lord employs aasimar, paladins, blink dogs, and kirin as his most common servants.[4] The holiest time for Ragathiel's followers is the brief moments before and after a battle. The faithful ask Ragathiel's eyes to fall upon them and for his wings to shield them.This is also a standard greeting and farewell among worshipers. Followers of Ragathiel commonly wear red and silver clothing.Many also don an ornament or sigil the color of flames, typically on the helmet. Ragathiel has a small but old cult in Magnimar, a city known for its many mystery cults revering various empyreal lords.   \nPaladin Code:   \n*I will avenge evil wrought upon the innocent.   \n*I will not give my word lightly, but once it is given, I will uphold a promise until my last breath.   \n*Those proven guilty must be punished for their crimes. I will not turn a blind eye to wrongdoing.   \n*Rage is a virtue and a strength only when focused against the deserving. I will never seek disproportionate retribution.   \n*Redemption finds hearts from even the cruelest origins. I will strive not to act upon prejudice against fellow mortals based on race or origin."

Texts mention a time when Rhan-Tegoth was active and alive and ruled an empire to the north on an unknown world far beyond Golarion, yet when its worshipers abandoned it, Rhan-Tegoth transformed into an immobile statue of an unknown material. Yet immobility should not in this case be taken for inactivity, as those who spend time in proximity to this strange statue find themselves compelled to undertake increasingly violent sacrifices before the slumbering Great Old One—mere proximity is apparently enough to enable the ancient entity’s mind to reach out and influence lesser intellects than its own. While records of Rhan-Tegoth’s waking periods and its activities during those times are rare and unreliable, rumors persist of certain chants capable of temporarily stirring the god from its eternal hibernation and restoring life and mobility to its petrified form. What purpose such chants could serve, one can only guess, for the Great Old One invariably devours those with the temerity to rouse it. The ancient texts do agree that when Rhan-Tegoth does finally waken of its own accord, the End Times themselves shall be upon all worlds. Yet it is unclear whether the apocalypse wakens the Herald of the End Times, or whether the god’s wakening triggers the end of all. Legends state that if Rhan-Tegoth could be eradicated, this shared apocalypse could be forever avoided, yet a method of destroying something that fundamentally embodies immortality has baffled even the gods. Many statues of Rhan-Tegoth exist, and it can be difficult, if not impossible, to discern which of these is the actual slumbering god. These statues depict a creature with a globular torso; six long, sinuous limbs tipped in crablike pincers; and a head with three fishy eyes and a long proboscis."

Supposedly, the empyreal lord Rowdrosh pitied these animals and taught them the wisdom of traveling together. Rowdrosh can take the form of any herd animal, and often travels the material world in such a guise. In his true form, he has the body of a muscular man with tanned skin and the head of a ram. Curls of bronze hair cover his face, shoulders, and chest. Two mas sive curled ram's horns made of moonstone sweep back from his temples, and he carries their incredible weight with ease. In his left hand, he wields a straight birch staff that strikes as hard as one of iron. Those who tend to herds of animals often pay homage to Rowdrosh. His agents counsel benevolent shepherds and herders, teaching them how to prevent disease among their animals and how to properly care for pregnant animals in lands where such knowledge is still scarce. Rowdrosh has a particular hatred for schirs and worgs, and his agents go out of their way to eliminate these brutish monsters. On the plains of Nirvana, Rowdrosh raises celestial steeds to serve as mounts for divine warriors. He has no permanent home, and is content to rove the upper planes for all eternity with his divine herd."

Having lived all their lives in the consistent climate of caves, the orcs were awed by the turbulence of the open air. The orcs associate the sounds of thunder and rain with the din of war, and the flash of lightning with the sparking of blade on blade. Orcs are not known for their love of nature, but they find a kindred spirit in the violent and unpredictable Thunderer. Rull is depicted as an orc with skin the color of storm clouds and a voice that resounds like thunder. Lightning bolts are his weapon of choice; he throws them down from the sky to impale enemies or to revel in random destruction. The Thunderer is happiest in the midst of noise and turmoil, whether the raging of a storm or the confusion of battle. Orcs thank Rull for the clouds, which block out the painful sun. Clear skies and still air are signs of Rull’s disfavor. At these times, the orcs attempt to appease the Thunderer by beating drums and clashing weapons.Priests of Rull practice ceraunomancy—divination by thunder and lightning—to ascertain the Thunderer’s will. Many orc bards and skalds view Rull as their patron, and seek to emulate his roaring with their loud, discordant battle songs."

The Minder of Immortals provides legal defense for souls at trial, arguing that a soul’s intentions and recounting of its own experiences must be weighed as heavily as the consequences. A poor loser, Saloc has resurrected mortals whose souls’ judgments the usher finds wholly unfair, giving the creatures an opportunity to demonstrate their truest selves. This disregard for etiquette makes Saloc an unpopular usher among psychopomps and especially reviled by Vale, who finds the Minder of Immortals’ tactics ironically juvenile. As the solicitor of will over context, Saloc is also the ultimate authority over deities and similar beings whose existence defines morality rather than caters to it—but they rarely have call to exercise this judgment. Born from the mortal need to defend actions and decisions, Saloc predates most other ushers and even many gods. They manifest as a roughly humanoid figure, with a featureless face crowned by stag horns and orbited by two eye-lined golden rings.

Like many of the ancient Osirian gods, she is a funerary deity, and she is responsible for protecting the canopic jar that holds the deceased's intestines. Selket is the goddess of embalming, and her epithet, Mistress of the Beautiful House, refers to the embalming pavilion where bodies are prepared for burial. Along with Isis, Neith, and Nephthys, Selket assists Anubis in protecting the dead. She is often paired with Neith, as Isis is with Nephthys, and in the form of seven scorpions, she guarded Isis when Isis was pregnant with Horus. When a woman later refused the expectant mother shelter, it was Selket who punished the woman for turning Isis away. Selket also guards the other ancient O sirian gods against the poisonous bite of Apep, and has assisted Ra on numerous occasions in his battles against the Devourer of the Dawn. Selket normally appears as a woman wearing a scorpion with a raised tail on her head, or more rarely, as a lustrous black scorpion with the head of a woman."

Seramaydiel's burnished red-gold hair falls in broad curls around her face and frames the white wings that rise from her slender back. She uses her heavenly double chromatic harp to lull evildoers into a false sense of security, then slays them, if she must, using holy darts projected from a narrow bronze tube she uses as a blowgun. The Lady of Inspired Notes speaks all languages and enjoys fostering communication between disparate parties, especially when doing so may avert potential violence. A diplomat negotiating peace between countries and a tavern patron trying to head off a bar fight are both regarded by Seramaydiel as emissaries ofher cause. Seramaydiel's home is a vast marble amphitheater on Nirvana where the empyreal lords sometimes congregate for music and dancing as Seramaydiel plays a tune from her enchanted harp, much to the delight of all in attendance."

He is evil personified, the enemy of all that is good, a god of sickness and disease, confusion and madness, rebellion and strife. He is a usurper, a murderer, and a stealer of souls. Set is the brother of Isis, Osiris, and Nephthys, who is also his consort. With Neith, Set is the father of Sobek. Set murdered Osiris, mutilated the body and scattered the pieces, and tried to steal his brother's throne, ushering in the Age of Darkness. Set is the enemy of both his brother Osiris and his nephew Horus. Set is opposed to Anubis as well, and the two war over the souls of the Osirian dead, with Anubis seeking to guide them safely to the Boneyard, and Set vying tosteal their souls or turn them into undead abominations. Set appears as a lean Osirian man with the head of a sha, also known as a Set-beast. Kinslayers, murderers, and usurpers all pay homage to Set, but he is also venerated by kings and pharaohs who value the god's cunning, strength, and power. Set is a patron of assassins, rogues, and necromancers, and he is worshiped by barbarians, warriors, and evil druids as well."

Sezelrian gave the orcs intelligence, so they could know and worship the gods who made them. Through religion, the orcs learned to channel the power of the gods, and thus the Fire God is also the god of magic. Sezelrian teaches that not everything can be fought with physical strength alone. An orc must be clever to control fire or magic, lest she get burned. Yet Sezelrian is still an orc god, and thus has no patience for knowledge without immediate practical use. Sezelrian is depicted as an orc witch doctor wielding a mace that continually emits smoke and sparks without burning. Often his true face is hidden behind a mask of a demonic visage wreathed in fire. Sezelrian rarely leads attacks against his fellow orc gods, but often serves as an adviser to one of his brothers against another, usual in conflicts he himself instigated. Sezelrian is least likely to ally with the bestial Nulgreth; he instead favors Zagresh, who at least appreciates the destructive power of fire. Regardless of which god they hold highest, all orc spellcasters—whether arcane or divine—owe thanks to Sezelrian. They show their respect with fire, integrating bonfires, burnt offerings, candles, and torches into their rituals. Tribes dedicated to the Fire God are generally more accepting of magicusers in their midst. Burns and brands often mark the flesh of those dedicated to Sezelrian."

Shei stands 8 feet tall and exudes quiet confidence and grace despite her eerie form. The empyreal lord's slender body appears to be that of a middle-aged woman, but her form is concealed beneath glossy black feathers and tightly wrapped bandages. The head of an ibis pours from her elongated neck, and in her hand she carries her silver sickle, Imminent Harvest, with her at all times lest evil catch her unawares. Though Shei possesses the wisdom of age, she also possesses the fiery passion of youth, making her an unpredictable force to be reckoned with even at the best of times. The Ibis Matron understands every stage of life, from infancy to old age, and sees the purpose of life as the attainment of self-actualization. Her servants find joy in helping mortals express their true selves through creativity, hard work, and service to their communities. Individuals in search of enlightenment, parents of small children, mothers about to bring life into the world, and teachers helping their students blossom all pay homage to Shei. The elderly feel particularly drawn to Shei, knowing that the Ibis Matron understands the weight of their long lives. Those who force others to hew to an uncomfortable mold rouse the wrathful judgment of Shei, as do fiends who corrupt mortals and rob them of their potential. The Ibis Matron has an esp ecial hatred for belier devils and their ilk. Evil creatures that weaken their victims through negative energy-particularly ones that cause premature aging, such as ghosts-also bear the brunt of Shei's glorious anger."

Shivaska’s cult has a particular interest in orphanages, and an unsettling number of these institutions have ties to the Chained Maiden. An orphanage under the secret control of the cult of Shivaska uses its orphans for all manner of cruel labor, and keeps the children in line by allowing unsettling aberrations (usually chokers) to prowl the orphanage after dark. Tales of monsters and fears of being taken away by strange things lurking in chimneys or cramped closets or hiding under the floorboards work quite well to keep child laborers in line. Shivaska’s realm on the Abyss is a gloomy temperate wilderness known as the Winding Wood. Her palace, the Ticking House, is an immense workhouse with a huge clock tower, the face of which accounts for 13 hours rather than 12.

Violent, aggressive, and prone to primal urges, Sobek is also a god of battle, venerated for his ferocity, strength, and military prowess. Sobek appears as a muscular man with the head of a mighty crocodile, wearing a headdress with tall plumes, curling horns, and a solar disk. He is the son of Neith and Set, and while he occasionally supports his father, Sobek more often stands alone. Sobek sometimes accompanies Ra on his solar barge, joining the sun god in his nightly battles against Apep. Kings venerate Sobek as a symbol of pharaonic potency and might. He is a patron of soldiers and armies, and he is worshiped by barbarians, druids, fighters, rangers, and warriors as well. Farmers often give offerings to Sobek so that he will enrich their fields and protect their livelihood. Sobek's temples are almost always situated on riverbanks, and are rarely found more than a few miles from a river. The crocodiles living in the neighboring rivers are exalted by the priesthood and the faithful as the direct offspring of the god, or are even seen as living incarnations of Sobek himself Most of his temples contain pools holding crocodiles sacred to Sobek, and their regular feeding is incorporated into worship. These honored reptiles are mummified and interred upon their deaths with all the respect and esteem that marks human funerals."

Those who guard ancient sites, particularly as selfappointed guardians, pray to Soralyon for the strength and perseverance to carry out their grave tasks, and Soralyon and his agents are constantly on guard against those who would defile sacred monuments. While the Mystic Angel sometimes favors researchers who show prudence and strong moral fiber, his agents quickly intercede when a mortal seeks to uncover, however unwittingly, a dangerous monument or evil bit of ancient lore-a trait that sometimes puts Soralyon at odds with preservationists such as Bharnarol or the caretakers of the Great Library of Harmonious Scripture."

Shadowed by afterimages, their form periodically breaks into a flurry of superimposed possibilities as they manipulate reality moment by moment, choosing the most opportune course of future actions—the only true constant in a creature of inconsistency. Ssila'meshnik occasionally frequents Pharasma’s court to argue in favor of or against the fate of particular souls. The chosen souls seem arbitrary at times, and this mind-set seems to be the focus of most of the Colorless Lord's followers. These worshippers tend to live as contradictions, choosing a path to follow in life while simultaneously taking actions that work against their chosen path. In addition, these worshippers spontaneously change their life paths at a whim, insistence upon the freedom to seek new fates being the only consistent thread in their lives. Ssila'meshnik has no known divine domain, but ancient texts record them as “Warden of Galisemni.” The city of Galisemni rests within the Maelstrom, containing a set of seven towering statues of keketars known as the Watching Seven."

His great golden eyes never close, and his sharp beak and fierce talons are always ready to tear apart those who challenge him. In his true form, Tanagaar is a giant owl, 14 feet tall, with luminous golden eyes; it is said that he can swivel his head in any direction and can see perfectly at any distance. Tanagaar's plumage is dusky platinum gray tipped with inky black, perfect for melding into the shadows of the forest. His beak and talons shine like platinum as well, but are actually cold iron, and never catch the moonlight to betray his position. Lookouts, guards, and forest wardens all pay homage to the Aurulent Eye. The empyreal lord is as concerned with law as any archon, and his influence envelopes borders, watchtowers, and wild preserves. His servants frown on poaching, but if such illegal hunting is done unwittingly or out of desperation, these celestial agents typically send poachers away with a stern warning and perhaps an offer of lawful aid. Poachers or trappers who leave wounded animals in distress or use cruel hunting tactics face the full wrath of Tanagaar's faithful. Guards who find themselves overwhelmed while defending legitimate borders may find unexpected aid from Tanagaar, and more than one border conflict has seen the tide of battle turn because of hundreds of screeching owls swooping down on the unlawful assailants. Tanagaar concerns himself with watching the borders of Heaven from the depths of the Unbent Forest on the lowest slopes of the mountain. There he maintains a force ofhound archon s couts who assist him in patrolling and defending their divine realm."

Many curse the usher’s name and regard them as an example of Pharasma’s indifference and cruelty, but others recognize that poison is in the dose, and that those fluids that kill can also bring life. Teshallas’s embrace allows mortals to grow and mature, to discover experiences and wisdom that eluded them earlier in life. While Dammar serves as the usher of doctors and healers, Teshallas is patron of herbalists and others who refine nature’s poisons into potent medicines. They are also the usher most associated with scaly folk, and they manage the souls of kobolds, lizardfolk, serpentfolk, and other cold-blooded sapients. The Primordial Poison manifests as a serpent devouring their own tail, supported by four feathered wings not physically connected to their looping body. Teshallas often wanders the Ethereal Plane but resides in the Bower Antimony, a greenhouse brimming with poisonous plants and extreme temperatures. Worshippers often maintain their own small gardens of poisonous plants in homage and use their crops to distill a variety of medicines."

No creature embodies this idea better than the Green Mother. The Green Mother resembles a beautiful humanoid woman with bark-like skin and green hair, her features a constantly shifting mix of elf, dryad, and nymph. As befits the Eldest most associated with simplistic human ideas of nature, her body regularly changes to incorporate natural features: hands becoming gnarled roots, hair becoming a literal waterfall, or skin suddenly becoming a mirror-smooth pond capable of sucking in and drowning an unfortunate lover. Travelers from beyond the First World are often quick to cast the Green Mother in one of two lights: either as the villainous temptress of morality plays or as the equally deadly seductress of bawdy tales (contributing to such thinly veiled sobriquets as \"The Feasting Flower\" and \"The Hungry Blossom\"). Yet the Green Mother is not merely a creature of lust. Rather, she is the seduction of nature incarnate, the caution to the unwary. She is the rolling landscape that calls to the wanderer, the primal need that leads salmon to spawn and die, the mantis gnawing on the corpse of her mate. She is both the flower’s bloom and the inevitable death that follows. To attempt to define her via mortal concepts of morality is to miss the point entirely. She is a master puppeteer, pulling strings that affect events even far beyond the First World’s borders. Though her sense of humor is dark, and many see evil in her tricks and traps, the Green Mother sees herself as merely impartial, helping to guide natural selection by uncovering and exploiting weaknesses. If the practice amuses her as well, surely she deserves such a small reward."

The Lantern King usually appears as a 1-foot-wide ball of floating golden light that shifts in color when making a point or expressing emotion, sometimes circled by glowing runes in the shape of a coronet. His form has led many to suggest that he was the original archetype for lantern archons or else the progenitor of all will-o’-wisps—both claims he laughs off without answering. Other than his name, the only outward sign of the Lantern King’s gender is his voice, a booming, merry baritone. While his preferred form as a ball of light is his most common and thus presumably true appearance, the Lantern King is also fond of transforming into the shapes of other creatures for the purposes of mischief, up to and including impersonating other Eldest. According to the Laughing Lie, his sole purpose is to make the First World less boring, preferably with the injection of a little good-natured chaos and confusion. Unfortunately for the plane’s other residents, what amuses the Lantern King isn’t always comfortable or pleasant, and even his “good-natured” pranks can be deeply inconvenient. For instance, the Laughing Lie might help a man whose house burns down by hiding a valuable magical sword in the ashes or the Eldest might transform the man into a fish, so that he need never fear fire again."

Whether or not it’s his original form, the Lost Prince always appears to his subjects as a pale human man dressed all in black, with completely black eyes and a mess of unruly black hair. The only bits of color are the glowing red symbols that seem tattooed across his brow in a coronet-like band, or the similarly glowing 4-pointed star on the back of each hand. Despite being painfully gaunt, the Lost Prince has delicate features that might be handsome, if not for his constant frown. Famous for his constant melancholy, the Lost Prince nevertheless has a large coterie of devoted servants and followers. While the love of these attendants might seem unwarranted by the thankless Eldest, the truth is that the Lost Prince has a tendency to quietly aid those who share his depression, particularly those who have lost their homes or families. He never admits to such acts, and those he helps receive the same surface-level disdain as all others, yet those who have found a second home in his court are fierce in their defense of his character. Though the Lost Prince himself rarely expresses much enthusiasm about anything, he has a keen interest in information about planar travel and the history of the multiverse."

Yet as the Pale Horse grew fat off mortal suffering, he also grew discontent. The pressures of freedom, the burden of leadership, and the weight of every choice shackled his heart and soured his meals. In a moment of weakness, he faltered in his daemonic nature and sought service. Pharasma offered the Pale Horse respite until he saved half again as many souls as he had damned. The Pale Horse prostrated himself before the Lady of Graves and wept in joy, freed now from his burden of choice. The Pale Horse has since become Pharasma’s avenging angel, hunting those who steal from the River of Souls as he once did. He luxuriates in his duties and obeys the tenants set forth by Pharasma, and his soldiers likewise obey without question. He represents both the pain and the bounty in servitude, guiding both those who die in service and those who die unattended and alone thanks to their own miserable choices. His wrath is legendary, especially in regard to daemons, and Abaddon long ago struck the Lash and the Plough’s true name from its monuments and libraries. Despite his apparent loyalty, some among the psychopomps worry the Pale Horse remains a daemon at his core, and that upon completion of his sentence he will visit an equally terrible vengeance upon the Boneyard. The Pale Horse appears as a powerful white stallion, missing its head save for a disembodied skull and a floating crown of flames, though he sometimes appears as a silent rider on a white horse."

He is also god of the moon and magic, particularly arcane magic. Thoth is also the patron of language, literature, and writing, and is said to have invented the hieroglyphs first used by Ancient Osirian scribes and that are still used, in modified form, in the modern Osiriani language. He is the reckoner of years, recording the passage of time and details of all the events of life, from the honorable reigns of kings to the simple daily lives of peasants. Thoth normally takes the form of a man with the head of an ibis, though occasionally his form is that of a seated baboon or even a man with the head of a baboon. He is the husband of Maat, the goddess of order and truth, and he serves as secretary and counselor to Ra. It was Thoth who gave Isis the magic words she used to resurrect her dead husband Osiris. He is the scribe of the gods, and mediates between them fairly in their disputes. Thoth is the patron of archivists, scribes, researchers, and scholars, and alchemists, witches, and wizards all worship him as the god of magic and spells. His temples usually include well-stocked libraries and archives, and often include orders of monks who venerate him for his knowledge and wisdom."

His light brown skin always holds a rosy flush, as though the empyreal lord had just stepped in from the cold. Numerous scars mar his broad face, which constantly sports a stern expression, though a kind light occasionally warms his hardened gaze. From his back stretch two arching tusks carved from celestial ice. Snow-Strider and his agents help worthy individuals struggling to live in cold, inhospitable climes. Many northern cultures credit Tole with teaching their people to build shelters from ice. Tole is a sworn enemy of Kostchtchie, and Tole's champions hone their skills in battle to best combat frost giants and white dragons. On occasion, a mortal champion catches Tole's attention long enough for the empyreal lord to grant this mortal divine strength and tactical knowledge with which to defend her kinsfolk. Tole can sometimes be found in the coldest reaches of Elysium's mountains, but his followers on the Material Plane claim to see Snow-Strider in their temple-longhouses with some frequency. Many believe he assumes the guise of a wanderer in need of respite and leaves flecks of gold in the bedding of those who provide him hospitality."

After a failed attempt to wrest that crown away from Cyth-V’sug, Treerazer fled to the Material Plane. Cyth-V’sug was unable to pursue, but took steps to ensure that Treerazer would remain there by exiling him, transforming Treerazer into a native outsider and severing his bond to the Abyss. He spent many centuries wandering the remote corners of Golarion before finally coming upon the abandoned elven nation of Kyonin in 2497 ar. In the Sovyrian Stone, he found an artifact that he believed he could use to reinstate his Abyssal link and, perhaps, even uproot the entire nation and refocus the portal from Sovyrian to the Abyss, thereby reclaiming his position there and taking one more step toward revenge against Cyth-V’sug. Yet the elves sensed his tamperings and returned to confront the demon. A terrific battle resulted, and while the elves were able to drive Treerazer out of Iadara and into southern Kyonin, they were unable to slay him or force him out completely—they merely concentrated his power in a smaller region. Instead, the elves walled off this region, a perverted realm known today as the Tanglebriar. Treerazer lurks at the Tanglebriar’s heart to this day, the greatest bogeyman in elven mythology and a very real and constant threat to the nation’s security. Cults of Treerazer are quite rare beyond Kyonin, where secret cabals of cultists venerate him. When they do appear beyond these borders, they are secretive but sadistic groups, eager to sacrifice nonbelievers yet cunning in remaining undetected by the law of the land."

Tsathoggua has a strange, almost whimsical nature; while evil and unpredictable, at times he can appear almost benevolent in his dealings with mortals. Yet such dealings are never long-lived, and more often than not end in tragedy for those who would treat with the Great Old One.

However, the aligned essence of these beings guides their actions, ensuring they use magic in a manner that befits their nature and the multiverse’s needs. Mortals, on the other hand, greedily seek out and exploit magic, possessing neither the underlying instincts to use it responsibly nor the eternity of practice to do so perfectly. But whether mortal spellcasters are cognizant of it or not, magic is a fundamental force guided by principles, and whenever simple creatures would trivialize or abuse magic, Valmallos presides. Valmallos considers mortals unpredictable and reckless, and seeks to keep them from treating magic as a toy. In part, he is responsible for the array of complex material, somatic, and verbal components so prevalent in magic, many of which act as gatekeepers to ensure an amateur cannot wield magic without putting in the requisite training and practice to use the power responsibly. As a result, Valmallos typically approves of wizards’ methodologies, and his faithful handle sorcerers and other innate spellcasters with extreme caution—and sometimes even with prejudice. Valmallos regards most other mortal spellcasters on a case-by-case basis, and the way in which one has used magic in the past matters far more to him than the esoteric tradition that granted the power in the first place. Valmallos sees his faithful less as worshippers than as students and advocates who can learn from him and further complicate magical practices to protect them from fools."

He taught the orcs how to forge blades and to build complex siege engines. While all orc gods are war gods, the Iron Warrior is the master of strategy. He disdains battle plans that rely solely on enthusiasm and overwhelming numbers to win the day. Instead, Varg teaches orcs, if not discipline, at least more efficient ways to use their strength. Varg favors weapons that not only deal damage, but also instill fear. The Iron Warrior knows that intimidation can defeat an enemy as quickly as any wound, and he sees no shame in striking from behind at a foe in retreat. Varg is depicted as an orc general wearing half-plate armor that was assembled from varied sources. He never wears a helm that would hinder his ability to see and hear what is happening on the battlefield. Varg has honed his abilities through countless battles against his brothers and the gods of other pantheons. When not opposing the Iron Warrior, the other orc gods depend on him to equip their armies. Varg is the most inventive and forward thinking of orc gods, but his genius is only for battle. His followers have little interest in using technology to improve other aspects of orc life, and the most devout of his faithful see innovation in other arenas as a blasphemous misuse of Varg’s gifts. All but the most savage orcs make use of metal weapons and armor, and they give thanks to Varg when they craft or steal these items. Tribes dedicated to the Iron Warrior make extensive use of siege weapons, and individual worshipers compete against each other to build the most complex and destructive devices of death."

He is the patron and protector of sacred sites, and his cold, earthy breath flows through the world’s mausoleums with eerie reverence. He has no patience for those who disturb sacred spaces, and many mortals—both Pharasmins and those who are simply superstitious—carve his holy symbol into tombs or fashion headstones in its shape to help protect the site from foul spirits and grave robbers. Those gargoyles who take up residence on cathedrals, temples, and tombs also pay at least lip service to this usher. Vavaalrav makes his home in the Wailing Tor, a tall, steepled tower in the heart of the Eight Courts. He manifests as a skeletal gray figure garbed in a breastplate, robe, and wings of stone, with three eyes upon his right hand. Whether his countenance bears any eyes as well remains unknown, as the Steeple’s Skull covers the top half of his head with a delicate silk veil."

Verex is a brazen thief who encourages orcs to take whatever or whomever they desire. He is the patron of plunderers and usurpers who take by force. Yet duplicity and stealth are not beneath Verex, so he is also the god of grifters and thieves. Orcs praise the Despoiler when their raids yield valuable treasures, but they may curse his name when they become the victims of theft or simply misplace an item. Verex is depicted as an orc rogue wearing studded leather armor, in contrast to the heavy hide and metal favored by his brothers. The Despoiler’s irises are the color of gold coins, and it’s said he can see the deepest desire of any creature that looks him in the eyes. In his time, Verex has allied with and stolen from all the other orc gods, though he has the least contact with Zagresh, who rarely possesses anything of value and is thus not worth the Despoiler’s time. As raiding is important to their survival, many orcs call upon the Despoiler when looting a village or pillaging a rival tribe, but his most dedicated worshipers are typically rogues. Tribes dedicated to Verex prefer guerrilla warfare to attacking en masse, and use diplomacy to deflect fights they can’t win—at least until they can attain a stronger position. For followers of Verex, success is measured in gold, mates, and slaves rather than kills; any orc who can attain goals through guile and deception is valued among Verex’s faithful."

Other angels rail furiously against the darkness and spend eternity battling its agents. But when Vildeis emerged from the ether of Heaven, it is said, she could not cope with the mere idea of evil-what reality allows such an abomination to exist? To preserve her sanity, Vildeis blinded herself so she could not see the foulness that so often tainted existence and dedicated herself wholly to destroying that which pained her so. Now, her zealous championing of rightness leaves her no peace. She cannot rest, cannot laugh, cannot pause to appreciate her efforts. Only action and repeated sacrifice keep her damaged spirit whole. The Cardinal Martyr's body is marked with countless scars, each one a celestial rune representing a sacrifice she has made. Crimson ribbons cover her useless eyes, and her magnificent red wings carry her aloft as she embarks on divine quests. Her curved dagger, Cicatrix, is never far from her side. Those who stand in Vildeis's shadow hear a maddening chorus of screams, the voices of all the martyred throughout the Great Beyond. Vildeis's followers commit themselves utterly to her worship. The Cardinal Martyr is a demanding mistress, and her tenets are so exact that it is easy to fall out of her favor. Followers of Vildeis give up their homes, families, and wealth to follow her dictums and receive no material reward for their service. To Vildeis's devout, sacrifice in the service of good is its own reward. Those who die acting in Vildeis's name may find rest in their final reward, but the most faithful and talented are raised to serve again, this time as Vildeis's divine agents. Vildeis has no home. She never pauses in her travels, for she is driven mercilessly by her cause."

Where Xhamen-Dor’s comet came to rest is unknown, but its cult agrees that the fallen star that bears the Great Old One’s core lies in the depths of a large but remote lake somewhere in the world. Since that date, Xhamen-Dor has slowly begun wakening, growing and sending filaments of its fungoid body throughout the world to rise up here and there to infest and spread. Those infected by the Inmost Blot first become sickly, then begin to simultaneously decay and transform, eventually becoming undead monsters animated by a combination of necromantic energy and the alien fungal masses that writhe in their cores. Cultists of Xhamen-Dor often take these parasitic creatures into themselves under the belief that they will live on as part of the creatures that emerge from their bodies, but just as often use unsuspecting sacrifices to serve as hosts. Foul Xhamen-Dor is said to have once resembled a tangled mass of fungoid tendrils growing from the shattered bones of some ancient reptilian lifeform, though what nightmarish shape the slowly growing blight has taken on today is unknown."

Yet those who would be so foolish as to expect kindness from Yig would do well to think again, for Yig does not suffer fools and is as likely to devour those who beseech him for aid as he is to provide aid. Even Yig’s most devout worshipers realize the god may simply wish to feed at times, and on these occasions, no amount of devotion can protect the supplicant from death. Yig is worshiped primarily by nomadic societies and those who live with a close connection to the land; veneration of him is all but unknown in urban regions. He protects communities that honor him in the right ways, particularly if they follow the complex rituals required of his worship through the seasons. His favor can result in bountiful harvests, good hunts, and strong and healthy babies—at times immaculate conceptions are attributed to Yig, particularly if the resulting children bear crescent-shaped birthmarks upon their brows. Conversely, when a society has displeased or failed Yig, its children are born with crippling or monstrous deformities that leave mothers dead and fathers insane. Yig speaks through the actions of serpents, yet he is rarely worshiped by serpentfolk. Indeed, the Father of Serpents has long been at war with the god Ydersius, although since the decapitation of Ydersius, Yig has turned his attentions elsewhere. Yig appears as a scaled, humanoid creature with a serpent’s head and lashing tail, or as an immense rattlesnake with a crescent-shaped mark upon the brow."

Ylimancha bitterly resents each race lost to Pazuzu's corrupting influence. The empyreal lord of coasts has two forms. One is that of a woman with the head of an osprey.

Distance has no meaning to him, yet he seems unable to properly exist in the reality shared by most mortal life. He can only partially intrude upon this dimension, taking on the shape of a slithering mass of iridescent spheres or glowing motes of light when he does. Or perhaps Yog-Sothoth can exist in this world but has no reason to do so, and what mortals see and tremble before is but his shadow. Yog-Sothoth’s cultists believe he is slowly preparing the many worlds of the universe for a new age presaged by the wakening of the Great Old Ones, during which time the inhabitants of these worlds will be wiped out to make way for the true masters. Cults often call upon Yog-Sothoth to bless unborn children, turning them into monstrous hybrids that help to prepare the unsuspecting world for the time when the stars themselves shall be right for the Great Old Ones to rule once again."

Unlike other orc gods who desire glory and power, Zagresh is a nihilist who fights only for survival, and lives only to destroy. Even orcs who profess a higher purpose revere Zagresh as the god of violent death, a fate to which all orcs aspire (those who die of natural causes are instead relegated to Dretha). Zagresh is described as a savage orc with monstrous tusks. The hides of large animals serve as his armor and clothing, and his weapon of choice is a spiked greatclub. Though he rarely uses articulate speech, Zagresh is not a quiet god. The Destroyer expresses his every emotion through animalistic growls and howls. In his joyous destruction, Zagresh’s roars echo across the battlefield and strike fear into the hearts of his enemies. The orc gods don’t ally with Zagresh so much as direct him against those they wish to annihilate. The Destroyer cares not for their machinations, only for mayhem, and as long as they provide him enemies to slaughter, he revels in the destruction. Worship of the Destroyer is more common among subterranean or less civilized and orcs. His followers rarely have much in the way of material wealth. They take joy in destroying the creations of civilized folk (including more organized orcs), and in fits of rage smash even their own possessions. The orc god of the dead is also the race’s god of the undead; even among civilized orcs, those who practice necromancy give homage to Zagresh, and those who don’t pray that Zagresh will keep their dead from rising."

The empyreal lord of determination and investigation, she revels in unwinding mysteries-the more complicated the better-as well as shedding light upon previously obscured events. Zohls sees existence as a series of interlocking puzzles and delights in discovering patterns. She is guided by logic more than instinct, and has trouble interacting with less perceptive beings, even fellow archons. She is an impatient empyreal lord who genuinely forgets that not everyone shares her talent for brilliant leaps oflogic. Zohls often appears practically dressed in a tunic and breeches and ties back her shining chestnut hair into braids. She favors clothing of black and white, representing the light of truth and the darkness of the unknown, and she reveals her celestial nature to the deserving by unfurling magnificent wings of parchment that never wrinkles. Investigators and researchers-who both seek the truth in their own ways-pay homage to the empyreal lord sometimes known simply as \"Verity.\" Her agents often appear incognito to give a crucial hint or provide a key piece of evidence to the faithful. Those who hide criminal deeds capture Zohls's ire most strongly, but anyone who seeks to keep acts, lore, or objects hidden may encounter interference from Zohls's agents. Zohls uses her abilities and her agents to uncover fiendish plots and unravel the machinations of evil, particularly devils. Zohls's palace on Heaven is filled with endless halls full of labeled evidence, research notes, maps covered in check marks , sketches of interesting individuals, and laboratory equipment. She rarely visits her fellow empyreal lords, finding them largely uninteresting and difficult to talk to."

Her profane symbol is a blood-red, fanged skull, embossed with runes. Zura is believed to be the first vampire in all of creation. Supposedly she was an ancient Azlanti queen who possessed a lust for eternal life so great she eventually resorted to feeding on her own kind. Even thousands of years later, people still whisper the legends of her decadent, savage feasts and her baths of warm human blood. Some scholars even claim that her ascension heralded the beginning of the ancient Azlant empire's descent into decadence and eventual destruction at the beginning of the Age of Darkness. Her sinfulness was so great that, on her death by botched suicide, her soul was sent to the Abyss, where she immediately arose as a succubus vampire. Her remaining family members changed their names and went into hiding after their estates were plundered and razed. Before Earthfall she had ascended to demon lord status. Zura now calls the mountainous Abyssal realm of Nesh her home. Nesh has a large number of villages inhabited by captured humanoids harvested from the Material Plane. They are, for the most part, unaware that they dwell deep in the Abyss, except the leaders, who are rewarded by Zura's minions to keep the truth hidden.   \nAppearance: She is said to appear as a voluptuous woman, with a dark gothic beauty that is almost impossible to resist. This beautiful form is merely a ruse she uses to seduce her victims; her true form is that of an emaciated woman with bat-like wings in place of arms, blood-red eyes and hair, large fangs, and taloned feet."

A bitter enemy of the goddess Pharasma, he is worshiped by small cults throughout Golarion. These groups foment tragedy and bring about accidents in the hopes of strengthening the power of their god.Followers of the Grim Harvestman believe that the god arose from the first maddened soul to die a pointless death. It is written that since that time, every mortal that dies in the same meaningless way is destined to be absorbed by Zyphus after death. This puts him in direct competition with the goddess Pharasma, and his followers believe that once he has acquired enough souls he will be able to engineer the death of Pharasma herself. Due to shared interests and hatred of Pharasma, Zyphus is known to consort with Urgathoa, even seeing her as a mentor."
