I'd like to give a huge thank you to Vek17, as much of the coding in this repository is his; I simply repurposed it or learned from it. I wouldn't be able to release
anything without it. Check out his mod, TableTopTweaks if you haven't already!

I'd also like to give a big shoutout and thank you to bubbles, Narria, CascadingDragon, and everyone else who has been so kind in the Modding discord.
Seriously, thank you!
