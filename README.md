kadynsTweaks is a mod that seeks to add more options and variety to the already amazing base game and contributions from other modders. I created this mod with the intent
of adding the Vindictive Bastard Archetype, but I'm only about halfway through creating that.

Currently, the mod allows all forbidden deities and racial class archetypes. I will be adding to it daily as things pique my interest, or if something is suggested to me.

I'd like to give a huge thank you to Vek17, as much of the coding in this repository is his; I simply repurposed it or learned from it. I wouldn't be able to release
anything without it. Check out his mod, TableTopTweaks if you haven't already!

I'd also like to give a big shoutout and thank you to bubbles, Narria, CascadingDragon, and everyone else who has been so kind in the Modding discord.
Seriously, thank you!

I will be adding many things, but first I'm going to finish vindictive bastard!
